<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Overeating: A Dialogue: An Application of the Principles of A Course in Miracles</h2><p>The dialogue presents the Course&#39;s approach to issues such as food addictions and preoccupation with weight. In a discussion with three students of A Course in Miracles, Kenneth points out the ego dynamics involved, and how forgiveness and the choice to accept the Holy Spirit&#39;s purpose of experiencing the peace of God, rather than the ego&#39;s purpose of fostering guilt can be applied to the issues raised.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He has written more than 25 books on the Course, including Love Does Not Condemn, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; The Message of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and many others. He has also produced over 150 audio and video titles discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder, with his wife Gloria, of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula, California.</p><h2>Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origin Of Species</h2><p>How do new species evolve? Although Darwin identified inherited variation as the creative force in evolution, he never formally speculated where it comes from. His successors thought that new species arise from the gradual accumulation of random mutations of DNA. But despite its acceptance in every major textbook, there is no documented instance of it. Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan take a radically new approach to this question. They show that speciation events are not, in fact, rare or hard to observe. Genomes are acquired by infection, by feeding, and by other ecological associations, and then inherited. <i>Acquiring Genomes</i> is the first work to integrate and analyze the overwhelming mass of evidence for the role of bacterial and other symbioses in the creation of plant and animal diversity. It provides the most powerful explanation of speciation yet given.</p><p><b>Lynn Margulis,</b> Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1983. She is best known for her pathbreaking work on the bacterial origins of cell organelles and for her collaboration with James Lovelock on Gaia theory. Her previous books include <i>Symbiosis in Cell Evolution; Five Kingdoms</i> (with K. V. Schwartz); and (with Dorion Sagan) <i>Origins of Sex, Garden of Microbial Delights, What Is Life?, What Is Sex?, </i>and<i> Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution.</i><b>Lynn Margulis</b>, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a recipient of the 1999 Presidential Medal of Science, is Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. <b>Dorion Sagan</b> is the author of <i>Biospheres</i> and the co-author of <i>Up from Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence</i>. He lives in New York City.A challenger of the orthodox "neo-Darwinist" interpretation of evolution, microbiologist Margulis has made her professional mark touting an alternative: symbiogenesis. She and coauthor (and son) Sagan have presented their ideas in earlier popular works (<i>What Is Life?</i>, 1995), but never as vigorously as in this volume. Essentially, the debate between neo-Darwinists and Margulis hinges on the definition of a species, and the manner in which a new one appears. To Margulis and Sagan, the neo-Darwinist model, which asserts random gene mutation as the source of inherited variations, is "wildly overemphasized," and to support their view, they delve deeply into the world of microbes. They detail the anatomy of cells with and without nuclei, positing a process of genome ingestion that creates a new species. Surprisingly, the upshot of Margulis' theories is the rehabilitation of Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, whose theory that supposedly acquired traits are hereditary has been ridiculed for 150 years. Polemical and provocative, Margulis and Sagan's work should set many to thinking that evolution has not yet been completely figured out. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The blood of young men spilled on the battlefields of war; the blood of civilians&#x2014;old and young, women and men&#x2014;that ran in the gutters of cities, towns, and villages across Europe; the blood of millions destroyed in the pogroms and death camps of the Holocaust.</p><p>But blood, too, as an idea. The Nazi belief&#x2014;absurd and obscene as this seems today&#x2014;in &#x201c;good blood,&#x201d; precious ichor to be sought out, preserved, and expanded. And with it, the inevitable counterpart: &#x201c;bad blood,&#x201d; to be identified and then ruthlessly eradicated.</p><p>I am a child&#x2014;a German child&#x2014;of a war based on and steeped in blood. I was born in 1941 in the depths of the Second World War: I grew up in its wake&#x2014;and under the shadow of its brutal and even more prolonged progeny, the Cold War.</p><p>My history is the history of millions of men and women like me. We are the victims of Hitler&#x2019;s obsession with blood, as well as the beneficiaries of the postwar economic miracle that transformed our devastated and pariah nation into the powerhouse of modern Europe.</p><p>Our story is that of a generation raised in the shadow of bloody infamy, but one that found a way to struggle toward honesty and decency.</p><p>But my own story is also that of a much more secret past: a history still cloaked in silence and shrouded in shame. It is a warning of what happens when blood is worshiped as the vital essence that determines human worth, and&#x2014;by extension&#x2014;used as the justification for the most terrible crimes man has inflicted upon man.</p><p>For I am a child of Lebensborn<i>.</i></p><p><i>Lebensborn</i> is an ancient German word, twisted and distorted by the word-smelters of National Socialism into a uniquely disturbing shape amid the vast and bizarre vocabulary of Hitler&#x2019;s Reich. What did it mean in the mad lexicon of Nazism? What does it mean today? To find the answers&#x2014;to uncover my own story&#x2014;has taken me on a long and painful journey: a physical journey, to be sure, which has led me across the map of modern Europe. An historical expedition, too: one that has required an often uncomfortable return to the Germany of more than seventy years ago, and into the troubled stories of those countries overrun by Hitler&#x2019;s armies.</p><p>But the search for who I am, and who I have been, has also forced me to make a psychological voyage into everything I have known and grown up with: a fundamental questioning of who I am, and what it means to be German.</p><p>I will not pretend that this is an easy story: it will not&#x2014;cannot&#x2014;always be easy to read. But as&#x2014;if&#x2014;you do, please keep in mind that neither has it been an easy story to live.</p><p>I am not, by nature, overtly emotional. The expression of emotion&#x2014;such a commonplace in twenty-first-century society&#x2014;does not come effortlessly to me. I have, I think, spent my life attempting to suppress my inner self, to subordinate my feelings to the circumstances in which I have grown up, as well as to the needs of others.</p><p>But this is a story that, I believe strongly, needs to be heard. More, much more, it needs to be understood. It is not unique, if by that we mean that there are others who have endured much of what has shaped my life and times. But, perhaps in defiance of the strict definition, there are, in life, gradations of uniqueness: and so, while I share a common thread with thousands of others who passed through the vile and perverse experiment of Lebensborn, to the best of my knowledge no one else shares the particular twists of fate, history, and geography that have defined my seventy-four years on earth.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p><i>Lebensborn.</i> The word runs through my life like the blood coursing through my body; a mysterious and powerful river, its route and progress obscure to the naked eye. To see it, to understand it, demands much more than a superficial examination: to find its source&#x2014;and thus the roots of this story&#x2014;requires a deep and intrusive investigation into the most hidden places.</p><p>And we must start in a town and a country that no longer exist.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>August 1942</p><p><i>Men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be shot, the women locked up and transported to concentration camps, and the children must be torn from their motherland and instead accommodated in the territories of the old Reich.</i></p><p>REICHSF�HRER SS HEINRICH HIMMLER,</p><p>June 25, 1942</p><p></p><p></p><p>CILLI, GERMAN-OCCUPIED YUGOSLAVIA:</p><p>August 3&#x2013;7, 1942</p><p>THE SCHOOL YARD was crowded. Hundreds of women&#x2014;young and old&#x2014;clutched the hands of their children and found what space they could in the packed courtyard; nearby, Wehrmacht soldiers, rifles slung over their shoulders, looked on as the families slowly drifted in from towns and villages across the area.</p><p>These women had been summoned by order of their new German masters, ordered to bring their children to the school for &#x201c;medical tests.&#x201d; Upon arrival they were arrested and told to wait. Otto Lurker, commander of the police and security services for the region, watched, relaxed and impassive&#x2014;his hands resting comfortably in his pockets&#x2014;as the yard filled with families. Once, Lurker had been Hitler&#x2019;s jailer; now he was the F�hrer&#x2019;s leading henchman in Lower Styria. He held the rank of SS <i>Standartenf�hrer&#x2014;</i>the paramilitary equivalent of a full colonel in the army&#x2014;but that summer&#x2019;s morning he was casually dressed in a two-piece civilian suit.</p><p>Yugoslavia had been under Nazi rule for sixteen months. In March 1941, as the surrounding countries of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria joined the Reich&#x2019;s alliance of Balkan nations, Hitler put pressure on the kingdom&#x2019;s ruler, the Regent Prince Paul, to fall into line. The prince and his cabinet bowed to the inevitable, formally tying Yugoslavia to the Axis Powers: but the Serb-dominated army launched a coup d&#x2019;�tat<i>,</i> replacing Paul with his seventeen-year-old second cousin, Prince Peter.</p><p>News of the revolt reached Berlin on March 27. Hitler took the coup as a personal insult and issued Directive 25, formally designating the country as an enemy of the Reich. The F�hrer ordered his armies &#x201c;to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a state.&#x201d; A week later, the Luftwaffe began a devastating bombing campaign while divisions of Wehrmacht infantry and tanks of the Panzer Corps swept through towns and villages. The Royal Yugoslavian Army was no match for German&#x2019;s Blitzkrieg troops: on April 17, the country surrendered.</p><p>The occupying troops immediately set about fulfilling Hitler&#x2019;s instruction to dismantle all vestiges of the state. Sixty-five thousand people&#x2014;primarily intellectuals and nationalists&#x2014;were exiled, imprisoned, or murdered, their homes and property handed over to the new German masters. The Slovene language was prohibited.</p><p>But for the rest of 1941 and throughout the first half of 1942, partisan groups, led by the Communist Josip Broz Tito, fought a determined campaign of resistance. Germany retaliated with a brutal crackdown: the Gestapo swooped on fighters and civilians alike, deporting thousands to concentration camps across the Reich. Others were selected to be executed as a warning against resistance. In a nine-month period beginning in September 1941, 374 men and women were lined up against the walls of the prison yard at Cilli and summarily shot. Photographers recorded the murders for posterity and propaganda.</p><p>On June 25, 1942, Heinrich Himmler&#x2014;the second most powerful and feared man in Nazi Germany&#x2014;issued orders to his secret police and SS officers to eliminate partisan resistance.</p><p><i>This campaign possesses every required element to make harmless the population which has supported the bandits and provided them with human resources, weapons and shelter. Men from such families, and often even their relatives, must be shot, the women locked up and transported to concentration camps, and the children must be torn from their motherland and instead accommodated in the territories of the old Reich. I expect to be provided with a special report on the number of children and their racial values.</i></p><p>Against this bloody backdrop, 1,262 people&#x2014;many the surviving relatives of the partisans executed as an example to the rest of the population&#x2014;assembled in the school yard that August morning to await their fate.</p><p>Among them was a family from the nearby village of Sauerbrunn. Johann Matko came from a family of known partisans: his brother, Ignaz, had been one of those lined up and shot against the wall of Cilli Prison in July and he had been dragged off to Mauthausen concentration camp. After seven months he was allowed to return home to his wife, Helena, and their three children: eight-year-old Tanja, her brother Ludwig&#x2014;then six&#x2014;and nine-month-old baby Erika.</p><p>When all the families were accounted for, an order was given to separate them into three groups&#x2014;one each for the children, the women, and the men. Under Lurker&#x2019;s direction the soldiers moved in and pulled children from the grasp of their mothers: a local photographer, Josip Pelikan, recorded the harrowing scene for the Reich&#x2019;s obsessive archivists. His rolls of film captured the fear and alarm of women and children alike; Pelikan also snapped off shots of scores toddlers held in low pens of straw inside the school buildings.</p><p>As the mothers waited outside, Nazi officials began a cursory examination of the children. Working with charts and clipboards, they painstakingly noted down each child&#x2019;s facial and physical characteristics.</p><p>These, though, were not &#x201c;medical tests&#x201d; as any doctor would know them; instead they were crude assessments of &#x201c;racial value&#x201d; that assigned each youngster to one of four categories. Those who met Himmler&#x2019;s strict criteria for what a child of true German blood should look like were placed in Category 1 or 2: this formally registered them as potentially useful additions to the Reich population. By contrast, any hint or trace of Slavic features&#x2014;and certainly any sign of &#x201c;Jewish heritage&#x201d;&#x2014;caused a child to be consigned to the lowest racial status of Categories 3 and 4. Thus branded as <i>Untermensch</i>, they had no value except as future slave labor for the Nazi state.</p><p>By the following day this rudimentary sifting was finished. Some children&#x2014;those deemed racially worthless&#x2014;were handed back to their families. But 430 other youngsters&#x2014;from young babies to twelve-year-old boys and girls&#x2014;were taken away by their captors. Rounded up by nurses from the German Red Cross, they were packed into trains and transported across the Yugoslavian border to an <i>Umsiedlunslager</i>&#x2014;or transit camp&#x2014;at Frohnleiten, near the Austrian town of Graz.</p><p>They did not stay long in this holding center. By September 1942 a further selection had been made&#x2014;this time by trained &#x201c;race assessors&#x201d; from one of the myriad organizations established by Himmler to preserve and strengthen the pool of &#x201c;good blood.&#x201d;</p><p>Noses were measured and compared to the official ideal length and shape; lips, teeth, hips, and genitals were likewise prodded, poked, and photographed to sort the genetically precious human wheat from the less valuable chaff. This finer, more rigorous sieving was used to reassign the captives to the four racial categories.</p><p>Older children newly listed in Categories 3 or 4 were shipped off to reeducation camps across Bavaria in the very heartland of Nazi Germany. The best of the younger ones in the top two categories would&#x2014;in time&#x2014;be handed over to a secretive project run by the <i>Reichsf�hrer</i> himself. Its name was <i>Lebensborn</i>; and among the infants assigned to its care was a nine-month-old baby called Erika Matko.</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>1945&#x2014;Year Zero</p><p><i>It is our will that this state shall endure for a thousand years.</i></p><p><i>We are happy to know that the future is ours entirely!</i></p><p>ADOLF HITLER,<br><i>TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, 1935</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>AT 2:40 A.M. on Monday, May 7, 1945, in a small, redbrick schoolhouse in the French city of Reims, Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, chief of operations for the German Armed Forces High Command, signed the unconditional surrender of the Thousand Year Reich. The five terse paragraphs of this act of capitulation handed over Germany and all its inhabitants to the mercy of the four victorious Allied Powers&#x2014;Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union&#x2014;from 11:01 p.m. the following night.</p><p>A week earlier, Hitler and most of his inner circle had committed suicide in the bowels of the Berlin <i>F�hrerbunker</i>. His chief henchman, SS Reichsf�hrer Heinrich Himmler&#x2014;the man in charge of the entire Nazi apparatus of terror&#x2014;was on the run, disguised in the coarse gray serge of an enlisted soldier and equipped with forged papers proclaiming him to be a humble sergeant.</p><p>It was over; six years of &#x201c;total war&#x201d; in which my country had murdered and plundered its way across Europe were finished. Now we had to live with the peace.</p><p>Who were we that May morning? What was Germany&#x2014;once the begetter of Bach and Beethoven, Goethe and Schiller&#x2014;in the aftermath of the brutality of the Blitzkrieg, let alone the filth and genocide of the Final Solution? What would peace look like to the victors and to the vanquished? Those would prove to be two very different questions, linked by a common answer.</p><p>A new term was coined to describe our situation in 1945: <i>die Stunde Null</i>. Literally translated, this means &#x201c;zero hour&#x201d;; but for the smoldering remains of Germany&#x2014;a country of ruins, shame, and starvation&#x2014;it was more accurately &#x201c;year zero&#x201d;: both an end and a beginning.</p><p>What did it mean to be a German from 11:01 p.m. on Tuesday, May 8, 1945? To the Allies&#x2014;the new owners of every meter of turf and of every individual life from the Mass in the west to the Memel in the east&#x2014;it meant subjugation, suspicion, and suppression. Never again, said the four occupying powers, would the poisonous twin rivers of German nationalism and militarism be allowed to rise up and flood across the continent. There would, within hours, be mechanisms and procedures put in place to enforce this noble ideal&#x2014;systems that, though I was too young to know then, would direct the course of my life.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>TO GERMANS, THIS existential question of identity meant something different again. Something much less philosophical, something that could be categorized as the three P&#x2019;s: physical, political, and psychological. And of this trinity, the greatest&#x2014;the most pressing&#x2014;was undoubtedly the physical.</p><p>Germany in May 1945 was a wasteland; a tortured tundra of blown-up bridges, torn-up roads, burned-out tanks. In the dying weeks and months of his Reich, consumed by madness and impotent rage, Hitler had issued orders to create &#x201c;fortress cities.&#x201d; The Fatherland, he pronounced, was to be defended to the last drop of pure German...</p></p><h2>The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse (New York Review Books (Paperback))</h2><p>The editors of this legendary and hilarious anthology write: &#34;It would seem at a hasty glance that to make an anthology of Bad Verse is on the whole a simple matter . . .

Prior to serving in World War I, he intended to pursue the legal profession; but after, having suffered two bouts of shell shock and one of malaria, he set his sights on journalism. In 1919, he became a columnist for&nbsp;<i>The London Daily Express</i>&nbsp;under the pseudonym &#x201c;Beach Comber.&#x201d; These pieces and those that he later wrote for&nbsp;<i>The London Daily Mail</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The London News Chronicle</i>&nbsp;capture Lewis&#x2019;s legendary wit and savage, though eloquent, impatience with modern trends and are collected in the volumes&nbsp;<i>At the Green Goose</i>&nbsp;(1923),&nbsp;<i>At the Sign of the Blue Moon</i>&nbsp;(1924),&nbsp;<i>At the Blue Moon Again</i>&nbsp;(1925), and&nbsp;<i>On Straw and Other Conceits</i>&nbsp;(1929). He wrote several literary biographies, acclaimed for both their spirited subjectivity and their attention to historical detail, taking on subjects ranging from Rabelais and Moli�re to Boswell and Habsburg Emperor Charles V.

In poor health, he traveled to Cornwall in 1900 for a brief recuperative visit, staying on seven years, and discovering what would prove to be his most enduring subject: Cornish life, its manners, its landscapes, and its dogged resistance to modern times.

The relationship between a writer and her local bookstore can last for years or even decades. Often it is the author's local store that supported her during the early days of her career and that works tirelessly to introduce her work to new readers. But authors are also readers and customers, just like us. For them, as for most of us, bookstores serve as the anchor for our communities, the place that introduces us to new ideas (and new neighbors), and that sets our children on the path to becoming lifelong readers and lovers of books. Brimming with original, deeply moving, funny, and exceedingly well-crafted tributes to bookstores, from Longfellow Books in Portland, Maine (Ron Currie, Jr.) to Powells City of Books in Portland, Oregon (Chuck Palahniuk) and everywhere in between, <i>My Bookstore</i> is a joyful celebration of our bricks-and-mortar stores and a clarion call to readers everywhere at a time when the value and importance of these stores should be shouted from the rooftops.<br></p><p>Ronald Rice has worked in book publishing as a sales and marketing professional for 25 years, working with and promoting bookstores.

If it is, then it is thanks to the valued works and even more valuable support of a host of writers who recognized that bookstores are more than places to sell their wares. Bookstores can be the soul of a neighborhood, the heart of a city. There are places with resident cats (like Brooklyn&#x2019;s Community Bookstore) and places without (Birmingham&#x2019;s Alabama Booksmith).

It&#x2019;s an inspiring moral and political struggle whose evolution parallels the story of America itself. To advance their cause, the opponents of slavery employed every available literary form: fiction and poetry, essay and autobiography, sermons, pamphlets, speeches, hymns, plays, even children&#x2019;s literature. This is the first anthology to take the full measure of a body of writing that spans nearly two centuries and, exceptionally for its time, embraced writers black and white, male and female. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Phillis Wheatley, and Olaudah Equiano offer original, even revolutionary, eighteenth century responses to slavery. With the nineteenth century, an already diverse movement becomes even more varied: the impassioned rhetoric of Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison joins the fiction of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, and William Wells Brown; memoirs of former slaves stand alongside protest poems by John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Lydia Sigourney; anonymous editorials complement speeches by statesmen such as Charles Sumner and Abraham Lincoln. <br><br>Features helpful notes, a chronology of the antislavery movement, and a16-page color insert of illustrations.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Using the image of a flitting hummingbird as a metaphor for the gossamer strands that connect these larger-than-life personalities, Christopher Benfey re-creates the summer of 1882, the summer when Mabel Louise Todd-the prot�g� to the painter Heade-confesses her love for Emily Dickinson's brother, Austin, and the players suddenly find themselves caught in the crossfire between the Calvinist world of decorum, restraint, and judgment and a new, unconventional world in which nature prevails and freedom is all.</p><p><b>Christopher Benfey</b>&nbsp;is the Mellon Professor of English at Mount Holyoke College and the author of the award-winning book&nbsp;<i>A Summer of Hummingbirds</i>.

He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.Signature<i>Reviewed by</i> Debby ApplegateIn his last two books, Christopher Benfey, a prolific critic, poet and professor of literature at Mount Holyoke, cultivated an unorthodox style of historical storytelling that spurns the traditional mechanics of cause and effect. To steal a phrase from poetry, we might say that he writes history in the lyric rather than the epic mode. The goal is to evoke the thoughts and feelings created by a particular time and place. He has previously applied this technique to Victorian America's discovery of Japan and Edgar Degas's year in New Orleans.Now Benfey turns to the more familiar territory of the 19th-century literary renaissance in New England. He focuses on some of the era's most famous writers, as well as lesser-known figures&#x2014;as the subtitle indicates: Love, Art, and Scandal in the Intersecting Worlds of Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Martin Johnson Heade&#x2014;all of whom found inspiration and self-expression in flowers and birds, the hummingbird above all. This is the book's MacGuffin: why did hummingbirds in particular elicit such a powerful attraction, rising at times to an obsession? Benfey's answer is that after the Civil War Americans gradually left behind a static view of existence, a trust in fixed arrangements and hierarchies, and came to embrace a new dynamism that found perfect expression in the hummingbird. By tracing their allusions to hummingbirds in poems, pictures, sermons and anecdotes, he shows how these sensitive souls registered the shock of war by seeking symbols of the evanescence of life. The elegiac mood gives way near the end, when sex wrestles the spotlight from death. Stowe's brother, a celebrated preacher, ensnares himself in a sex scandal, Heade begins a flirtation with the magnetic Mabel Loomis Todd, who throws him over for Dickinson's married brother, and the reclusive poetess embarks on her own late-life love affair. Whether Benfey's book succeeds depends on the expectations of the reader. This is not a conventional cultural history, nor is it a linear history of literary influences. Instead, to borrow from a description of Dickinson's hummingbird poems, it presents a fusion of realistic detail and vaporous suggestion. Those who aren't already familiar with the period&#x2014;and even many who are &#x2014;might drift as the author flits, birdlike, from one poignant tableau to another, beckoned by the wafting scent of yet another reference to birds or flowers. (He suffers some minor errors of fact and interpretation, due to an excessive dependence on secondary sources, but they don't alter the overall effect.) This book fares best when seen not as an argument but as a meditation on a moment in history, in which the reading experience itself recreates those feelings of evanescence. <i>Debby Applegate won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for the biography</i> The Most Famous Man in America <i>(Doubleday).</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by his experiences in the army, 'The Two Hussars' contrasts a dashing father and his mean-spirited son. Illustrating Tolstoy's belief that art must serve a moral purpose, 'What Men Live By' portrays an angel sent to earth to learn three existential rules of life, and 'Two Old Men' shows a peasant abandoning his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in order to help his neighbours. And in the highly moving 'Master and Man', Tolstoy depicts a mercenary merchant travelling with his unprotesting servant through a blizzard to close a business deal - little realizing he may soon have to settle accounts with his maker.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels&nbsp;<i>War and Peace&nbsp;</i>(1869) and&nbsp;<i>Anna Karenina</i>(1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts. At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>A Sentimental Journey (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A Sentimental Journey</b> is a novel without a plot, a journey without a destination.

Does interpretation go all the way down? Is there such a thing as a pure fact that is interpretation-free? If not, how are we supposed to know what to think and do? These tantalizing questions are tackled by renowned thinker John D. Caputo in this wide-reaching exploration of what the traditional term "hermeneutics"&nbsp;can mean in a postmodern, 21st-century world. As a contemporary of Derrida's and longstanding champion of rethinking the disciplines of theology and philosophy, for decades Caputo has been forming alliances across disciplines and drawing in readers with his compelling approach to what he calls "radical hermeneutics."

Its computer technology was out-of-date. The Cold War, which fueled much of the narrative, was long over. Not only in the sense that the superpower confrontation has, if not ended, at least substantially cooled. But our national mind-set has also changed. Who today would believe that a major power might seriously consider launching a preemptive strike over a question of weapons development, a scenario that was front and center in the original <i>Hercules Text</i>? Somehow it seemed not entirely implausible in 1986.</p><p>It&#x2019;s possible that my original perspective was simply deranged. But it didn&#x2019;t feel that way then. I can still recall the nuclear-attack drills in high school, during which we descended, in an orderly manner, down to the basement cafeteria and sat under tables, which would presumably protect us when the bomb dropped. At home, left over from my father&#x2019;s days as a WWII air-raid warden, we had a bucket of sand for tossing on fires. For some reason we never threw it out. It served as a reminder that terrible things were possible.</p><p>In 1962, at the height of the Berlin Crisis, I was driving home on the Baltimore&#x2013;Washington Parkway, headed for Philadelphia. At the time there was major construction going on, crews building overpasses and widening highways, but catastrophe seemed so imminent it was difficult not to wonder why we were bothering. The night was thick with the conviction that it was all going to get knocked down in the near future.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t happen, of course, a reality for which we can be grateful to a series of U.S. presidents and Russian premiers who kept their heads. Had they not been there, today&#x2019;s world might have been little more than a pile of smoldering ash.</p><p>But the current reading public has a different perspective, and so it seemed prudent to go back and reframe <i>The Hercules Text</i> in the light of these happier times. I&#x2019;ve done that, and the experience has left me, as the original effort did in 1986, with the suspicion that we do not really want to hear from the stars. No matter how hard we root for SETI. And no matter what the outsiders may have to say to us. No news is good news.</p><p></p><p></p><p>| | | ONE | | |</p><p>Harry Carmichael sneezed. His eyes were red, his nose was running, and his head ached. It was mid-September, and the air was full of pollen from ragweed, goosefoot, and thistle. He&#x2019;d already taken his medication for the day, the latest antiallergen. It seemed to accomplish little other than to make him drowsy.</p><p>Through the beveled stained-glass windows of the William Tell, he watched the Ramsay Comet. It was now little more than a bright smudge, wedged in the bare, hard branches of the elms lining the parking lot. Its cool, unfocused light was not unlike the cool glow of Julie&#x2019;s green eyes, which seemed preoccupied with the long, graceful stem of her wineglass. She&#x2019;d abandoned all attempts to keep the conversation going and sat frozen in a desperate solitude. She felt sorry for Harry. He could see it in the set of her jaw, in her tendency to gaze <i>past</i> him, as though a third person hovered behind his right shoulder. Years from now, he suspected, he would look back on this evening, remember this moment, recall the eyes and the comet and the packed shelves of old textbooks that, in the gloomily illuminated interior, were intended to create atmosphere. He would remember his anger and the terrible sense of impending loss and the numbing conviction that he was helpless. That nothing he could do would change anything. But most of all, it would be her sympathy that would sear his soul.</p><p>Comets and bad luck: It was an appropriate sky. Ramsay would be back in twenty-two hundred years, but it was coming apart. The analysts were predicting that on its next visit, or the one after that, it would be only a shower of rock and ice. Like Harry.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not anything you&#x2019;ve done, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course not. What accusation could she bring against faithful old Harry, dull Harry, who&#x2019;d taken his vows seriously, who could always be counted on to do the decent thing, and who&#x2019;d been a reliable provider? Other than perhaps that he&#x2019;d loved her too deeply.</p><p>He&#x2019;d known it was coming. The change in her attitude had been gradual but constant. The things they&#x2019;d once laughed over had become minor irritants, and the irritants scraped at their lives until she came to resent even his presence.</p><p>So it had come to this, two strangers carefully keeping a small round table between them while she used a shining knife and fork to slice methodically into beef that was cooked a little more than she would have preferred.</p><p>&#x201c;I just need some time to myself, Harry. To think things over a bit. I&#x2019;m tired of doing the same things, in the same way, every day.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m tired of <i>you</i>, she was saying, finally, with the oblique words and the compassion that peeled away his protective anger like the skin on a baked potato. She put the glass down and looked at him, for the first time, it might have been, during the entire evening. And she smiled. It was the puckish, good-natured grin that she traditionally used when she&#x2019;d run the car into a ditch or bounced a check. My God, he wondered, how could he ever manage without her?</p><p>&#x201c;The show wasn&#x2019;t so good either, was it?&#x201d; he asked drily. The William Tell was a dinner theater, and they&#x2019;d just suffered through a dreary mystery-comedy. Although Harry could hardly be accused of having made an effort to follow the proceedings. Fearful of what was coming later, he&#x2019;d spent the time trying to foresee and prepare for all eventualities, rehearsing responses, defenses, explanations. He&#x2019;d have done better to watch the performance.</p><p>The final irony was that there were season tickets in his pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t really care much for it.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t add anything that might have given him comfort, that she was distracted, that it was a difficult evening, that it was hard to keep her mind on anything so trivial while her marriage was disintegrating. Instead, she surprised him by reaching across the table to take his hand.</p><p>His love for her was unique, the only truly compelling passion he had ever known, the single element that fueled his days, that gave purpose to everything he did. The passing years had not dimmed it; had in fact seeded it with the shared experience of almost a decade, had so entwined their lives that no emotional separation would be possible, now or ever. Harry would not be able to leave her behind.</p><p>He took off his glasses, folded them deliberately, and pushed them down into their plastic case. His vision was poor without them. It was an act she could not misinterpret.</p><p>Bits and pieces of talk drifted from the next table, where two people, slightly drunk, whispered angrily at each other about money and relatives. Harry and Julie had never done anything like that. Relations between them had always been cordially correct. Even when, at last, the knife had come out.</p><p>A handsome young waiter, a college kid probably, hovered in the background, his red sash insolently snug round a trim waist. His name was Frank. It was odd that Harry, who usually forgot incidental names immediately, should remember that, as though the detail were important. Frank arrived every few minutes, refilling their coffee cups, asking whether he could get anything else for them. Near the end, he inquired whether the meal had been satisfactory.</p><p>It was hard now to remember when things had been different, before the laughter had ended and the silent invitations, which had once passed so easily between them, stopped. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think,&#x201d; she said abruptly, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re a good match anymore. We always seem to be angry with each other. We don&#x2019;t talk&#x2014;&#x201d; She looked squarely at him now. Harry stared back at her with an expression that he hoped suggested his sense of dignified outrage. &#x201c;Did you know that Tommy wrote an essay about you and that idiot comet last week? No?</p><p>&#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t exactly know how to say this. But do you think, do you really believe, that if anything happened to Tommy, or to me, that it would have any real impact on you? That you&#x2019;d even notice we were gone?&#x201d; Her voice caught and she pushed the plate away and stared down into her lap. &#x201c;Please pay the bill, and let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t true,&#x201d; he said, looking for Frank the waiter, not wanting to endure a scene in the restaurant. But Frank was preoccupied. Harry counted out some twenties, dropped them on the table, and stood up. Julie slowly pulled her jacket around her shoulders and, with Harry in her wake, strode between the tables and out the door.</p><p>Tommy&#x2019;s comet hung over the parking lot, splotchy in the September sky, its long tail splayed across a dozen constellations. Last time through, it might have been seen by Socrates. The data banks at Goddard were loaded with the details of its composition, the ratios of methane to cyanogen and mass to velocity, of orbital inclination and eccentricity. Nothing exciting that he had been able to see, but Harry was only a layman, not easily aroused by cold gas. Donner and the others, however, had greeted the incoming telemetry with near ecstasy.</p><p>There was a premature chill in the air, not immediately evident perhaps because no wind blew. She stood on the gravel, waiting for him to unlock the car. &#x201c;Julie,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;ten years is a long time to just throw away.&#x201d;</p><p>She watched a van pull into the lot. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Harry took Farragut Road home. Usually, he would have used Route 214, and they&#x2019;d have stopped at Muncie&#x2019;s for a drink, or possibly even gone over to the Red Limit in Greenbelt. But not tonight. Painfully, groping for words that would not come, he guided the Chrysler down the two-lane blacktop, through forests of elm and littleleaf linden. The road curved and dipped past shadowy barns and ancient farmhouses. It was the kind of highway Harry liked. Julie preferred expressways, and maybe therein lay the difference between them.</p><p>A tractor-trailer moved up behind, watched its chance, and hammered by in a spasm of dust and leaves. When it had gone, its red lights faded to dim stars against dark forest, Harry hunched forward, almost resting his chin on the steering wheel. Moon and comet rode high over the trees to his left. They would set at about the same time. (Last night, at Goddard, the Ramsay team had celebrated, Donner buying, but Harry, his thoughts locked on Julie, had gone home early. She seemed not to have noticed.)</p><p>&#x201c;What did Tommy say about the comet?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;That you&#x2019;d sent a rocket out there and were bringing a piece of it back. He promised to take the piece in to show everybody.&#x201d; She smiled. He guessed it took an effort.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t our responsibility,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Houston ran the rendezvous program.&#x201d;</p><p>He felt the sudden stillness and sneezed into it. &#x201c;Do you think,&#x201d; she asked, &#x201c;he cares about the administrative details?&#x201d;</p><p>The old Kindlebride farm lay cold and abandoned in the moonlight. Three or four pickups and a battered Ford were scattered across its overgrown front yard. &#x201c;So where do we go from here?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long silence that neither of them knew quite how to handle. &#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it would be a good idea if I went to live with Ellen for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about Tommy?&#x201d;</p><p>She was looking in her bag for something. A Kleenex. She snapped the bag shut and dabbed at her eyes. &#x201c;Do you think you could find time for him, Harry?&#x201d;</p><p>The highway went into a long S-curve, bounced across two sets of railroad tracks, and dipped into a tangled forest. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>She started to reply but her voice betrayed her, and she only shook her head and stared stonily through the windshield.</p><p>They passed through Hopkinsville, barely more than a few houses and a hardware store. &#x201c;Is there somebody else?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Someone I don&#x2019;t know about?&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyelids squeezed shut. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nobody else. I just don&#x2019;t want to be married anymore.&#x201d; Her purse slid off her lap onto the floor, and when she retrieved it, Harry saw that her knuckles were white.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Bolingbrook Road was thick with leaves. He rolled over them with a vague sense of satisfaction. McGorman&#x2019;s garage, third in from the corner, was brightly lit, and the loud rasp of his power saw split the night air. It was a ritual for McGorman, the Saturday night woodworking. And for Harry it was an energetic island of familiarity in a world grown slippery.</p><p>He pulled into his driveway. Julie opened her door, climbed smoothly out, but hesitated. She was tall, a six-footer, maybe two inches more in heels. They made a hell of a couple, people had said. A mating of giants. But Harry was painfully aware of the contrast between his wife&#x2019;s well-oiled coordination and his own general clumsiness.</p><p>&#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; she said, with a hint of steel in her voice, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never cheated on you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; He walked by her and rammed his key into the lock. &#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d;</p><p>The babysitter was Julie&#x2019;s cousin, Ellen Crossway. She was propped comfortably in front of a flickering TV, a novel open on her lap, a cup of coffee near her right hand. &#x201c;How was the show?&#x201d; she asked, with the same smile Julie had shown him at the William Tell.</p><p>&#x201c;A disaster,&#x201d; said Harry. He didn&#x2019;t trust his voice sufficiently to elaborate.</p><p>Julie hung her cardigan in the closet. &#x201c;They did all the obvious gags. And the mystery wasn&#x2019;t exactly a puzzle.&#x201d;</p><p>Harry liked Ellen. She might have been a second attempt to create a Julie: not quite so tall, not quite so lovely, not nearly so intense. The result was by no means unsatisfactory. Harry occasionally wondered how things might have gone had he met Ellen first; but he had no doubt that he would in time have betrayed her for her spectacular cousin.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it was a slow night on the tube, too.&#x201d; She laid aside the book. The strained silence was settling into the room. She looked from one to the other. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Gotta go, guys. Tommy&#x2019;s fine. We spent most of the evening with Sherlock Holmes.&#x201d; That was a reference to a role-playing game.

What happens when therapists are able to function as a sacred mirror for their clients&#39; essential nature, reflecting back not only the contents of awareness�thoughts, feelings and sensations�but awareness itself? Informed by their direct experience as well as by nondual teachings from both eastern and western wisdom traditions, the authors take a fresh look at what psychotherapy can be. These seminal essays will challenge and inspire readers to approach psychotherapy in a new way�as a potential portal for experiencing their deepest nature as free and joyful beings.Seasoned clinicians, Dan Berkow, Stephan Bodian, Dorothy Hunt, Sheila Krystal, Lynn Marie Lumiere, Richard Miller, John Prendergast, John Welwood, Jennifer Welwood and Bryan Wittine, and innovative western spiritual teachers, Adyashanti and Peter Fenner, explore critical issues at the interface of psychology and spirituality from a nondual perspective.</p><p><p>John J.

This is the time of year we might describe as "back to school," but in France, the season has a bigger narrative because it's when most French people come back from their six-week holiday, tanned, rested, and ready to begin anew. It also signals big events around Paris, including Fashion Week, the Salon du Vintage, F?te des Jardins, and Paris Design Week. There's a lot of excitement over the new museum exhibits, concerts, ballet, and all the cultural happenings the City of Light has to offer her devoted citizens. It's also the time of year when France's top writers see their creations filling the bookstore shelves.<br><br>I am here in Paris in search of a deeper understanding to the meaning of Parisian charm. After months and months of preparatory e-mails and phone calls, I have created a kind of course syllabus for myself-a semester's worth of research, reading, and conversation-my own do-it-yourself charm school.<br><br>And so, I arrive on this sunny day for my first meeting at Caf&#x17d; de Flore on Boulevard Saint-Germain and I immediately see Edith de Belleville. You can't miss her. She stands in front of the caf&#x17d;, looking very pretty, wearing her signature ensemble-a kerchief in her hair, a dress with a pattern of tiny red and white polka dots, red bangles to match, high heels, and a string of beads in the style of Coco Chanel. Edith and I give a bisou (a kiss) on each cheek and agree that the day is glorious and, ah, isn't Paris simply the most wonderful city in the world?<br><br>Edith hosts the rather famous Edith's Paris, tours specializing in literary Paris, as well as the great Parisian women in history. Her tours are informed by her insatiable interest in French social and literary history. She was educated at the Sorbonne and she's incredibly well-read. Edith was married to a Canadian, and while she has visited Toronto, she did not want to live in Canada because, as she tells it, It is too cold and impossible to wear high-heel shoes in the snow!<br><br>I realize that this is a French woman's particular gift-to be articulate and well traveled, but to take the conversation and effortlessly throw in a silly aside that makes you laugh and completely disarms you. And then, once disarmed, Edith will switch gears and give you a little lecture on the importance of Stendhal, the Chambre Bleue, and the great literary salons of seventeenth-century Paris life. She has a talent for presenting all this French social and literary history in a theatrical, slightly gossipy, and very funny style. Truly, after just a short time with Edith, you feel as if it's 1925 and you're hanging out at Harry's Bar at the Ritz with Hemingway and Fitzgerald, and look-in walks the barefoot artist's model, Kiki de Montparnasse. You can practically taste the sting of the dry whiskey and smell a cloud of French perfume.<br><br>And so Edith takes my arm and pulls me past the tourists and the couples sitting at the outdoor tables drinking their caf&#x17d; cr?me or their espressos and watching the theater of life passing by on the sidewalk. Edith tells me that we will not sit outside, but inside the caf&#x17d;, upstairs. This is where the true Parisians sit, she explains. This is where we can really talk.<br><br>I met Edith years ago during a book event at the American Library in Paris, where I was speaking with the author Harriet Welty Rochefort, author of Joie de Vivre. Edith was in the audience and she stood up during the question-and-answer period and pronounced-enthusiastically, and rather provocatively-that this whole idea of the French woman is a myth. There is no such thing as this quintessential French woman!<br><br>And then, with her passionate protestations, she went on to show in word and deed that she was the absolute embodiment of the quintessential French woman, because she was a mix of the most delightful and frustrating inconsistencies and a complete dichotomy. She was dressed all in vintage, wearing a red blazer with a silk flower at the lapel, and a flirty skirt, but her ideas were quite modern. She was sweet and smiled more than French women are known to smile, but she was also incredibly argumentative. In one moment she complimented me and in the next moment, she challenged me. More than anything else, she was completely her own person, and that made her very, very French and, yes, the quintessential French woman.<br><br>It's because of this original encounter that I wanted to meet with her and ask her about this thing called charm and why French women seem to have so much of it.<br><br>I follow Edith into the caf&#x17d;, past the huge mirrors and the art deco posters of Paris, up the circular stairs to the upper floor. "Simone de Beauvoir wrote The Second Sex while at the Caf&#x17d; de Flore," she says, a little breathless, quickly negotiating with the waiter to find us the perfect table. "The Second Sex sold over one million copies in the US in 1949 and two hundred thousand copies in the first week in France." She gives me a serious look with her big brown eyes as we sit down at the red leather banquette, facing the window overlooking the bustling boulevard below. "So you see, it's good luck for writers."<br><br>We order coffee. Edith is talking-talking-talking. It's hard to keep up with her. She jumps from how Colette discovered Audrey Hepburn to play Gigi on Broadway to how she adores Swedish men, then on to Stendhal and Bonaparte and something called "crystallization"-a condition to describe falling in love beyond all reason.<br><br>Edith has a Louise Brooks-style black bob with bangs, mercurial mannerisms, and, as mentioned before, big brown eyes. Oh, and red lipstick.<br><br>She is a true Parisienne, born and bred in Belleville-across the street from Edith Piaf's birthplace, she tells me. "I come from a working-class part of Paris, but I got a great education."<br><br>When I ask her about the secret to Parisian charm, she tells me it's very simple. "Develop your intellect. Don't show a man you're interested in him. Show him you're an interesting person." She goes on to explain how even a high school student will have eight hours of philosophy each week, where they read the literature of Nietzsche, Kant, Rousseau, and Freud, among many others. "The French are expected to form their own opinions and to be able to discuss and disagree, but still maintain their charm," she explains to me. Edith tells me how when she was a teenager, she attended the Fran?ois Truffaut film festival, and how these iconic French films from the 1960s made a tremendous impact on her life.<br><br>Edith opens her purse, takes out a book, and hands it to me. "Here, you can have this," she tells me. "I didn't care for it." I take the book and thank her. It's a well-worn English language copy of Lucy Wadham's The Secret Life of France. For a book she doesn't like, it certainly has been read. The pages are warped and as I flip through, I notice water stains inside. I wonder if she read the book in the bath?<br><br>As we are talking, Edith spots a couple at a nearby table. Actually, they are not exactly a couple. I turn to see an older, gray-haired gentleman and a slightly younger woman with long blond hair. She leans in and holds a small recorder up rather close to the man's lips. He is pontificating about something or other. I assume it's important, because he gestures, patting his hand on the caf&#x17d; table for emphasis, and the woman nods in rapt attention, a serious expression on her pretty face.<br><br>"That's Laure Adler," Edith tells me. "She's a famous journalist. She's always in here, doing interviews."<br><br>I glance over at their table again, as discreetly as possible, and Edith whispers in my ear, "She's a feminist intellectual. She wrote the book The Women Who Read Are Dangerous." And then Edith gives me a meaningful look. "Les femmes qui lisent sont dangereuses."<br><br>We sip our caf&#x17d; and Edith gives me the history of Saint-Germain-des-Pr&#x17d;s and how it became the place for intellectuals and artists, even surpassing Montparnasse. Edith tells me she is learning Chinese. "That's how I flirt," she says. And then she tells me a story about how she has an admirer and she's known this man for quite a long time, but the other day, they happened to be with some people from China and without a moment's hesitation, she began speaking Chinese to them. Well, the admirer was startled. He had no idea she could speak Chinese! "That's how the French flirt," she explains. "This little surprise would not be nearly as effective if I just boasted-hey, I know Chinese! No, it's the surprise that makes it fun."<br><br>I must admit I am enamored over this kind of flirtation. Perhaps it's because I admire education and reading, but I think it's more than that. I think I like this form of flirtation because it's available to anyone-anyone who wants to take the time to develop her intellect.<br><br>"Read, read, read! Feed your spirit."<br><br>Edith's parting words to me, as I leave her, are: "Read, read, read! Feed your spirit."<br><br>Girls Who Wear Glasses<br><br>My mother once told me that when she was coming of age in the 1940s, there was an expression, Men don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.<br><br>To our ears today, this sounds terribly dated. After all, especially now, eyeglasses are certainly having their style moment, and we have entered an era where Jenna Lyons, the former creative director of J.Crew, rocks the thick black brainiac frames. Lately, we've seen eyeglasses on the models on the catwalk and the runways in Paris, Milan, New York, and London. The Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o is famous for her fabulous eyeglasses. They have their own Twitter page! Young women are buying up prescription-less eyeglasses in an effort to cultivate the intellectual look.<br><br>It seems as if we are searching for a way to be taken seriously, to be appreciated for our depth and sensitivity. It's as if we are saying, Please listen to me-I'm smart. I'm serious. Look, I'm wearing eyeglasses!<br><br>As women, I believe we all want the world to realize we're complicated, we're sensitive, and when you look at us, there is more than meets the eye. We're not just a pretty face and we're not shallow or easily accessible. At the very least, if you want to seduce us, you'll have to create a convincing reason for us to take off our eyeglasses.<br><br>On a deeper level, those thick-framed eyeglasses are symbolic of a woman who sees the world clearly, but also wants to keep people at a slight distance. The eyeglasses serve as a kind of buffer, an object that is the modern version of the paper hand fan, something she can hide behind, create a little mystery, and slow down any potential admirers. Both eyeglasses and a paper hand fan can be used to conceal and can be used to reveal. Both are powerful props. Eyeglasses create the illusion, and perhaps proclaim the reality, that a woman is smart, well-read, intellectual, and interesting.<br><br>Reading Is Sexy<br><br>All this is lovely, but truthfully, it's a shortcut to what French women have always known.<br><br>We must educate ourselves and we must bring together that most irresistible combination of beauty and brains. We must read. Yes, I am actually suggesting that the very first introductory class in Parisian Charm School is this: read some books.<br><br>And afterward, you can pile a few of them on top of your head and practice your posture, but that lesson is for another day.<br><br>Parisian Charm School Lesson<br><br>Before you can even approach the idea of captivating a man's heart, you must first captivate your own. There are lots of ways to discover (or rediscover) your own spark. French women do this by cultivating an intellectual life. As simple as this sounds, begin your journey by reading.<br><br>But, don't simply stay at home and read. Rather, you must go out into the world. Begin by going to your local library and taking some books out on loan.<br><br>French women know that reading is very sexy.<br><br>Books love fresh air. It's true. The experience of reading is transformed when you get lost in the imaginary story, and then look up to see your world with new eyes. The leaves on the trees look a little greener, the air is warmer, and the sky is bluer. Read in the park, at a caf&#x17d;, in a bookstore, or if it's a rainy day, read at the library. You can read from a tablet, but I would like to make the case for carrying an old-fashioned hardcover book with you. In fact, carry a big book with an interesting cover.<br><br>Consider that this book is an objet d'art, an artifact. It's a tangible object and it's also a great conversation starter. In fact, an interesting-looking book is a wonderful way to let someone know you're intelligent and curious about the world.<br><br>Reading a good book is the beginning because it will help you decide what you love, whether it's stories from the past or stories with an imaginary vision of the future. Then again, you might find yourself reading about the cure for polio, or jazz in the 1950s. Perhaps your books will be filled with pictures, art from the Fauvist period. From this first exploration, you can focus on what moves you on a deeper level. Is it dance, tennis, stargazing, or the science of beekeeping? If it's art, then look at your local event listings and attend the latest exhibitions. Be sure to look for receptions and openings at small, local galleries. Look for interesting workshops and classes.<br><br>This interest in culture and community is one of the most important secrets to charm. You will more than likely meet someone at such an event, and even if you don't, you will have something interesting to talk about when you find yourself with that handsome man next to you at the Stravinsky concert.<br><br>The truth is, when you're engaged in something you love to do, you are more naturally attractive, and you're probably not even thinking about meeting a man, which makes it even easier to meet one. So yes, begin with what you feel passionate about, and what makes you happy.</p><h2>Temeraire (Temeraire, Book 1)</h2><p>Naomi Novik&#39;s stunning series of novels follow the global adventures of Captain William Laurence and his fighting dragon Temeraire as they are thrown together to fight for Britain during the turbulent time of the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Will Laurence has been at sea since he was just twelve years old; finding a warmer berth in Nelson&#39;s navy than any he enjoyed as the youngest, least important son of Lord Allendale. Rising on merit to captain his own vessel, Laurence has earned himself a beautiful fiancee, society&#39;s esteem and a golden future. But the war is not going well. It seems Britain can only wait as Napoleon plans to overrun her shores. After a skirmish with a French ship, Laurence finds himself in charge of a rare cargo: a dragon egg bound for the Emperor himself. Dragons are much prized: properly trained, they can mount a fearsome attack from the skies. One of Laurence&#39;s men must take the beast in hand and join the aviators&#39; cause, thus relinquishing all hope of a normal life. But when the newly-hatched dragon ignores the young midshipman Laurence chose as its keeper and decides to imprint itself on the horrified captain instead, Laurence&#39;s world falls apart. Gone is his golden future: gone his social standing, and soon his beautiful fiancee, as he is consigned to be the constant companion and trainer of the fighting dragon Temeraire!</p><p>Naomi Novik was born in New York in 1973, a first-generation American, and raised on Polish fairy tales, Baba Yaga, and Tolkien.

Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the man make the times or does the times make the man?</p><p>In <i>Leadership</i> Goodwin draws upon four of the presidents she has studied - Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson - to show how they first recognized leadership qualities within themselves, and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entry into public life, when their paths were filled with confusion, hope, and fear, we can share their struggles and follow their development into leaders.</p><p><i>Leadership</i> tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to forever shatter their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times. </p><p>No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities and temperament, they shared a fierce ambition, a hunger to succeed beyond expectations. All four, at their best, were guided by a sense of moral purpose that led them at moments of great challenge to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.</p><p>This seminal work provides a roadmap for aspiring and established leaders.

But when her husband, Porter, leaves his job as a hospice doctor to hike the 2,663-mile Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada, she refuses to let him go alone--even though the prospect of leaving their comfortable Houston home, hiking twenty miles a day while popping anti-depressants and hormones, and sleeping outside for six months terrifies her. Carrying Porter's handmade ultralight equipment, they sizzle in the Mojave Desert, nearly drown fording a swollen river, kick steps up icy mountains in the High Sierra, and stumble through the lava fields of Oregon. With every step and switchback, as the trials of the trail test and deepen their relationship, Gail and Porter each walk into the question <i>Who am I?</i>&nbsp;Gail, confronting dangerous weight loss and her mother's prolonged illness back home, feels herself irrevocably changed by life on the trail. She faces down a mountain lion and fierce alpine storms, alternately frightened by nature's power and inspired by its profound force--finding a wisdom that three master's degrees and a life in the city never taught her. This journey of harrowing hilarity and reluctant revelations will be loved by active hikers (appendices include details of their unique ultralight gear and other essential how-to information), fans of female adventure stories, and those just as happy at home kicking back with a glass of champagne.</p><p>Gail D.

You'll find all the information on materials too. You'll discover how to depict some popular 'themes' regarding skies - stormy, low cloud, a glow, sunset and summer skies. Geoff's paintings shown throughout the book provide plenty of inspiration. The 6 step-by-step projects ensure that you can have a go and improve your techniques. This updated and revised edition includes previously published work.

Geoff Kersey's revised and updated book , How to Paint Skies brings us plenty of practical advice on how to tackle the subject of skies in watercolour and give a sense of cohesion and atmosphere to your work. Skies covered include, amongst others, a stormy sky, a summer sky, evening glow, sunset and low cloud.

I reviewed this on its original publication in 2006, so there's little to add here except to say that the reissue has been redesigned and that some additional material has been added from Geoff's Top Tips for Watercolour Artists to beef up the technical sections. The result is a freshness that belies the book's age and it feels, as it is, thoroughly up to date. Originally reviewed 22nd August 2006: It's all John Constable's fault. If he hadn't been a Suffolk lad, English painting wouldn't be so tied up in big skies. That's the thing about a flat landscape: there's not a lot of foreground and an awful lot of up there and, because we have an island climate, there's a lot going on in it as well. So, an English landscape is always going, more or less, to stand or fall on its sky and another book on the subject is always handy. This one comes in Search Press's Watercolour Tips &amp; Techniques series which is aimed at painters who have developed a reasonable facility but are still in the relatively early stages of the learning process. Lavishly illustrated and with plenty of detailed step-by-step demonstrations, there's never any problem with seeing what's going on and all of the books in the series are clearly written and presented and are easy to follow. Geoff Kersey is a capable painter and he is particularly good at handling and demonstrating the use of washes and granulation to achieve a variety of effects that make for interesting and varied skies. If I have a quibble, it's that maybe his foregrounds are a little bit flat and that the overall result maybe doesn't scream "hang me on the wall" as loudly as it might, but that's a personal preference. You're not buying the paintings, you're buying a book that'll help you paint effective skies and that's what this will do. It's a book that'll repay continued study and almost certainly will help you quite thoroughly on your way. It's not one of those books that looks good but fails to deliver or one which you'll admire like heck but know you'll never emulate. It's a money well spent. * Artbookreview.net * Skies are a tricky yet essential part of landscape paintings.

Author Frances Worthington researches the three wives/concubines (Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah) of Abraham, and traces their lineage to five different religions - Christianity, Judaism, Islam, the Babi Faith, and the Baha&#39;i Faith.

The power of these meditations is that they reflect the author's personal spiritual journey into the depths of God's kingdom within&#x2015;within the soul, within personal relationships, within nature and the cosmos. <br><br>Part one of <i><b>Lazarus, Come Forth!</b></i>&#x2015;"The Miracle of Raising Lazarus in World History"&#x2015;looks at an encounter with the Father through the miracles of Creation and the Fall and through Moses and the Old Testament Covenant and the Ten Commandments. <br><br>Part two, "The Ten Commandments: The Revelation on Mt. Sinai," is a meditation on the seven miracles of Christ as described in the Gospel of St. John, culminating in the raising of Lazarus, the miracle of being raised from forgetfulness, sleep, and death to remembrance, wakefulness, and resurrection. Lazarus thus becomes a paradigm for understanding the spiritual and cultural history of humanity. <br><br>In part three, "Thy Kingdom Come: The Three Kingdoms of Nature, Humanity, and God," we consider the encounter with the Holy Spirit and living out the life of Christ through the Church. We are asked to reflect on the three kingdoms of God, humankind, and nature, which give natural order and meaning to the Christian life.<br><br>The union of love and prayer in the Spirit is the focus of the first section of part four, "The Breath of Life," in which we are invited to see our natural breathing as breathing the breath of God. And part four ends with "Natural and Supernatural Images of the Holy Trinity," which discusses the message of the starry heaven at night, the message of the setting Sun, and the message of the birth of a new day. <br><br>This volume should not be missed by anyone with a serious interest in esoteric Christianity or who merely wishes to go more deeply into the meaning of the Holy Scriptures. <br><br>A previous edition of this work was titled <i>Covenant of the Heart.</i> It is a translation of <i>Lazarus, komm heraus.</i> The translation has been fully revised.</p><p><b>Valentin Tomberg</b> (Feb. 27, 1900&#x2013;Feb. 24, 1973) was born into a Lutheran family in St. Petersburg, Russia. As an adolescent, he was drawn to the hermetic Martinism of G.O.Mebes, as well as to Theosophy and the mysticism of Eastern Orthodoxy. Tomberg&#x2019;s mother was killed by looters during the Russian Revolution, after which Valentin and his father fled to Tallinn, Estonia, where Tomberg studied languages and comparative religion at the University of Tartu. As a young man, he was strongly influenced by Vladimir Soloviev and had a personal experience of the Sophia at a cathedral in Holland. In 1925, he joined the Anthroposophical Society, under whose auspices he lectured in Holland and England and wrote on his understanding of the Bible, Anthroposophy, and esoteric Christianity. During World War II, he left the Anthroposophical Society and its internal struggles and converted to Catholicism. In 1948, he moved to England, where he became a translator for the BBC and monitored Soviet broadcasts during the Cold War, while continuing his devotion to meditation practice and further writing on his esoteric insights. In 1960, he retired to Reading near the River Thames. He died while vacationing in Majorca.

In journal entries from age seventeen until his AIDS-related death at thirty-seven, In the Shadow of the American Dream chronicles the life of a radical artist who unequivocally defied bigotry even as he became a target for the right wing. It tells the story of Wojnarowicz's creative birth, from publishing his first photographs and writing what would become The Waterfront Journals to completing his tour de force, Close to the Knives, at the height of his fame. In the Shadow of the American Dream is finally a record of the private Wojnarowicz, falling in love, exploring erotic possibilities on the Hudson River piers, becoming overwhelmed by the demands of survival, and searching for the pleasure and freedom he believed one could live on.<br></p><p>At the time of his death in 1992, David Wojnarowicz was one of the most vital and important names in the New York arts scene. His openness about his HIV status and engagement in public debates about health care and AIDS policy placed his highly political and determinedly provocative art and writing in a new context. <i>In the Shadow of the American Dream</i> is a collection of journal entries from 1971 (when he was 17) to his death. As he alternates between living on New York's Lower East Side and hitchhiking around the country, we can see the evolution of the artist not only as a young man beginning to understand his life and the world but as a social and political critic. <p> Wojnarowicz's life was difficult--from his unhappy childhood and adolescence to periods of homelessness and ostracism, coupled with overwhelming despair and loneliness. Yet, ultimately, <i>In the Shadow of the American Dream</i> is a joyful book. We see how Wojnarowicz's art became his salvation--even in the face of AIDS--and his life finally opened and expanded to be able to include other people in ways that never happened before, including a close friendship with photographer Peter Hujar. Wojnarowicz also presents us with insightful commentary on the New York arts scene and the enormous effect AIDS had on gay male life and culture. While <i>In the Shadow of the American Dream</i> is a moving, sometimes frightening self-examination of the life of a gay artist, it is also testimony to how mainstream America treats not only its artists but its radicals and visionaries. <i>--Michael Bronski</i></p>Few artists in the late twentieth century have captured the emotional, sexual, and political chaos of urban life like David Wojnarowicz. In the Shadow of the American Dream chronicles Wojnarowicz's life from age seventeen until his AIDS-related death at thirty-seven, and draws on his experiences at the margins of American society. After his HIV+ diagnosis Wojnarowicz engaged in highly public debates about health care, homophobia, and censorship, creating deeply political art even as he became a target for the right wing. <p>In the Shadow of the American Dream tells the story of Wojnarowicz's emergence as an artist and writer: from publishing his first photographs-the Arthur Rimbaud in New York series-and writing monologues based on the world of outsiders he encountered; to touring Europe as a renowned painter and publishing his tour de force, Close to the Knives. In the Shadow of the American Dream offers an intimate glimpse of the New York art scene in the 1980s, and is finally a record of the private Wojnarowicz, falling in love for the first time, exploring erotic possibilities on the Hudson River piers, becoming overwhelmed by the demands of survival, and searching for the pleasure and freedom he believed one could live on. </p><p>"These are well-chosen diary excerpts-beginning with an Outward Bound excursion in 1971 and concluding with the final entry from 1991."-Library Journal </p><p>"AS in his excellent collection, Close to the Knives, these sad yet unsentimental stories of his own and other's decline are unforgettable."-Publishers Weekly </p><p>"A harrowing journal of lust, creativity, and privation . . .

Dr. Hale&#39;s incredible experience in tiny, mountainous Nepal are surpassed only by his talent for telling about them. Imagine, for example, the culture shock of moving to a Hindu country under such rigid religious control that it is not only illegal to proselytize, but illegal to change religions as well. Imagine further the shock of moving to that country as a missionary doctor. Thomas Hale and his wife, Cynthia, also a physician, too on that awesome challenge in 1970.God wasted no time teaching tom the peculiarities of his new culture. But His unusual method left Tom wondering what God was up to. Here is how Tom tells about it:&#34;These were not the phlegmatic, easy-going Nepalis described in books and orientation courses. Those who spoke gesticulated fiercely. Some looked around menacingly; others spat. One thing was certain, however: in the cause of their anger they were united. The word was out: the new doctor had killed a cow. My own sense of participation in the proceedings was intense. I was the new doctor.&#34;--ExcerptAs Tom goes on to describe the events the preceded the angry scene in the Nepali village, the image of the spiritually superior missionary quickly evaporates. In a humorous, yet deeply insightful way, the author makes it clear that he is merely a servant, using his skills to the glory of God.Tom concludes this chapter with a thoughtful confession:&#34;In the long run, that cow did much more for me that I did for it. The mild-mannered, uncritical beast made me see in myself those negative attributes I had always ascribed to other American surgeons. Facing two hundred angry men proved to be effective therapy for removing most traces of condescension with which I previously regarded them. It also improved my relations with missionary colleagues and with Nepali brothers and sisters in the church. I guess God had no gentler way of removing some of my imperfections. I only wish I could say, for His trouble, that He finished the job. But it was a start.&#34; -- Excerpt.Dr. Hale&#39;s book refused to be preachy or condescending. It presents missions as a &#34;want&#34; rather than an &#34;ought.&#34; It is sensitive, warm, honest, incredibly funny, and filled with important truths illustrated from unusual and sometimes unimaginable situations.</p><p>In 1970, Thomas Hale and his wife, Cynthia, went to Nepal to work for their first twelve years at a rural mission hospital in the village of Amp Pipal. Subsequently they moved to Kathmandu, Nepal&#39;s capital city, where they have continued their work with the mission. Recently Cynthia took a position as an associate professor at Nepal&#39;s only medical school, and Tom has written a one-volume commentary on the New Testament, first in Nepali and subsequently in English for translation into other languages.chapter one Scrap Metal A few months before I completed my duty as an army surgeon, Cynthia and I began the hectic business of outfitting ourselves for Nepal: sleeping bags, kerosene heaters, step-down transformers, kitchenware, tools, refrigerator, washing machine, typewriter, a five-year supply of clothes in increasing sizes for two growing boys (ages one and four), five years of Christmas presents&#x2014;everything, it seemed, but a toilet seat. (Cynthia's mother would bring that the following year.) Nothing was available in Kathmandu we were told, and if it wasn't available there, we reasoned that it certainly wouldn't be available anywhere else in Nepal. We packed everything in large drums. For padding we crammed rolls of toilet paper (which supposedly wasn't available in Kathmandu either) into the empty spaces, two huge cartons of it purchased at bargain rates from the army PX. I can still recall the wide-eyed girl at the PX checkout counter staring at our pile of goods, then at us, then back to the pile. Why did we need eight different sizes of children's shoes, all at one time? And enough toilet paper to last a company of men six months? What were we going to do with the stuff&#x2014;go into the retail business? There were regulations about that sort of thing. We explained that we were going to a very remote area where these items weren't available, and she told us there was no place so remote that it wouldn't have a PX. We said we weren't going to be with the army, which only confirmed her suspicions that we were into something illegal&#x2014;or that we at least were abusing the system. Finally we were rescued by a senior clerk who had read in the bulletin of the base chapel about our going to Nepal. "No problem," he said cheerily, helping us carry our purchases outside. The toilet paper cartons were too big to fit inside our Volkswagen station wagon, so we had to tear them open in the parking lot and throw the rolls in one by one. We got everything home in just two trips. Two months before our scheduled departure for Asia, a letter came from the United Mission to Nepal saying we had been assigned to a small fifteen-bed hospital located out in the hills, a day's journey from Kathmandu. The hospital was still under construction. There wasn't even a road to it. We would have to fly to a grass landing strip and then hike six miles up a mountain. Cynthia was stunned. This was more than she had bargained for. Since we were both highly trained, certified specialists&#x2014;Cynthia in pediatrics and I in general surgery&#x2014;we had assumed we would be assigned to the big 125-bed mission hospital in Kathmandu. It was the second largest hospital in the country, located in a large palace once used by Nepal's ruling family. There we reasoned we would be able to put to use a good part of our training. But what were we going to do in a tiny, ill-equipped rural outpost? The letter put an end to Cynthia's long-cherished visions of missionary life in Kathmandu: the open and tastefully furnished home; the opportunity to entertain educated and influential Nepalis&#x2014;perhaps even royalty; the piano concerts; an elegant but not extravagant wardrobe; the chance to use her silver service (a wedding present as yet unused, saved especially for Kathmandu). After all, the upper classes needed God as much as the poor. But suddenly all those visions were swept away and replaced by a crude mud-walled house, where our neighbors would be illiterate and unkempt hill people. Cynthia made her biggest adjustment to life in Nepal right then and there. For me, on the other hand, the challenge of a pioneer situation and the chance to rough it held great appeal. But it created another problem: What was I going to do for surgical instruments? A surgeon is helpless without instruments, and I didn't own even a pair of forceps. Under normal circumstances, hospitals provide whatever equipment a surgeon needs, but certainly this tiny rural hospital wasn't going to provide any. I had spent the past twelve years learning to be a surgeon, and here I was being put in a place where I would be unable to do what I'd been trained for. I saw myself spending the rest of my professional career treating runny noses, colicky babies, worms, and the itch&#x2014;all cases that paramedicals were perfectly competent to handle. Twelve years of training and experience down the drain. And so Cynthia and I found ourselves chafing at what we later would recognize was our first lesson in missionary life: Be prepared for a comedown. Being asked to do something other than we were trained for was not what bothered us so much; it was being asked to do less. We learned what every missionary must sooner or later learn: If it's job satisfaction you expect, forget about being a missionary.</p><h2>Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed</h2><p>Michael K. Jones's new history of Stalingrad offers a radical reinterpretation of the most famous battle of the WW2. Combining eyewitness testimony of Red Army fighters with fresh archive material, the book gives a dramatic insight into the thinking of the Russian command and the mood of the ordinary soldiers. He focuses on the story of the Russian 62nd Army, which began the campaign in utter demoralization, yet turned the tables on the powerful German 6th Army. He explains the Red Army's extraordinary performance using battle psychology, emphasizing the vital role of leadership, morale and motivation in a triumph that turned the course of the war.<br><br>Colonel-General Anatoly Mereshko fought throughout the battle as staff officer to the commander, Chuikov. Working with the author much of Mereshko's testimony is entirely new - and will astonish a western audience. It is backed up by accounts of other key veterans and the recently released war diary and combat journals. These show that the oft-repeated descriptions of Stalingrad's two critical days of fighting - 14 September 1942, when the Germans broke into the city, and 14 October, when they launched a massive attack on the factory district - disguise how desperate the plight of the defenders really was. In their place is a far more terrifying reality. Grasping this, we come to see Stalingrad as more than a victory of successful tactics - rather, as an astounding, improbable triumph of the human spirit.</p><p>Michael Jones is well-known for his innovative, controversial studies of warfare. A former university lecturer in medieval history, he now works as a freelance writer, presenter and battlefield tour guide. He has written numerous articles on warfare for journals. Since 1984 he has been guiding visitors around battlefields, including Stalingrad, Bannockburn, and the battlefields of the Hundred Years&#39; War.</p><h2>Krondor the Betrayal:: Book One of the Riftwar Legacy (Riftwar Legacy, 1)</h2><p>The RiftWar is done. But a fearsome army of trolls and renegade humans, emboldened by the drug of destruction, has risen in strength from the ashes of defeat. There is one, however, who defies the call to battle... <p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling fantasist Raymond E. Feist returns to a beleaguered realm of wonders and magic-where war is an enduring legacy; where blood swells the rivers and nourishes the land. Attend to this hitherto untold chapter in the violent history of Midkemia -- a towering saga of great conflicts, brave acts and insidious intrigues. It is the story of a traitor who rejects the brutality of his warlike kind and casts his lot with the human targets of their fierce aggression. It tells of mysterious deaths and sinister machinations -- and signs of a time when the fate of many civilizations rested in the able, unfaltering hands of RiftWar veterans Squire Locklear and cunning their-turned-squire Jimmy the Hand. It chronicles the powerful awakening of Owyn -- apprentice magician of untried strengths -- and celebrates the selfless achievements of Pug, the great sorcerer of two worlds. Welcome now to astonishing new corners of a world you have not yet fully explored-and prepare to experience true excitement, blood chilling terror...and the triumph born from the doom aimed at the beating heart of a kingdom.</p></p><p>The video game industry has always drawn upon works of fiction for inspiration--sooner or later, the process had to reverse itself. <i>Krondor the Betrayal</i> began its life as the bestselling role-playing video game of all time, written by Raymond E. Feist for Dynamix Inc. Feist, whose <i>Serpentwar Saga</i> has sold millions of copies and established him as one of the most popular fantasy authors of modern times, also wrote this novelization which places the action of the game in the context of his fully-realized fantasy setting, Midkemia. <p>Feist's fans are legion. Longtime readers will be delighted at the return of popular characters Pug the Wizard, Squire Locklear, and others, as they face the menace of a marauding elf war-chieftain and a mysterious cabal of wizards. But first-time Feist readers may find <i>Krondor the Betrayal</i> baffling and tiresome--without the momentum of the larger series, much of the story's effect is diminished. The video game influence in this book is unmistakable--as evidenced by an encumbrance of sword fights, multilevel conspiracy, and two-dimensional characters. Anyone who enjoys reading about Midkemia will be thrilled to play the demonstration version of the CD-ROM game (included with the book). <i>--Brendan J. LaSalle</i></p><p><strong>Raymond E. Feist</strong> is the author of more than 30 previous books, including the internationally bestselling &#x201c;Riftwar Cycle&#x201d; of novels set in his signature world of Midkemia.

It was an age when Andrew Jackson redefined the presidency and James K. Polk expanded the nation's territory. Bancroft Prize�winning historian and literary critic David S. Reynolds captures the turbulence of a democracy caught in the throes of the controversy over slavery, the rise of capitalism, and the birth of urbanization. He brings to life the reformers, abolitionists, and temperance advocates who struggled to correct America's worst social ills, and he reveals the shocking phenomena that marked the age: violent mobs, P. T. Barnum's freaks, all-seeing mesmerists, polygamous prophets, and rabble-rousing feminists. Meticulously researched and masterfully written, <i>Waking Giant</i> is a brilliant chronicle of America's vibrant and tumultuous rise. </p></p><p><p>"A remarkable synthesis, impressive on many levels. . . . Reynolds applies his vast erudition to a period too often treated as mere prelude to the country's most destructive war. . . . A remarkable feat of distillation. . . . Reynolds is most adept handling the period's art and literature--he is remarkably clear-eyed about the Transcendentalists--and he brilliantly explores the religious scene's variety, tumult and frequent humbuggery. More than anything, he conveys the era's sheer weirdness."<br> -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)</p> <p> "Bancroft Prize winner Reynolds has produced a thorough chronicle of America from 1815 to 1848. . . . His book will appeal to general history buffs and American studies students. Highly recommended."<br> -- <i>Library Journal</i></p> <p> "In this fluid narrative, Reynolds recounts how politics, religion, art, literature, and economics jostled in forming a distinctively national American culture. . . . Exemplified by the intensification of feelings over slavery, the tensions in American society become vibrantly manifest in the eminent hands of Reynolds."<br> -- <i>Booklist</i> </p> <p> "Offers a fine addition to the literature on pre-Civil War American history in this account of the years 1815-1848. . . Even knowledgable readers will relish the chapters on social history. . . . Reynolds delivers a straightforward, insightful history of America during its bumptious adolescence."<br> -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p> "A really good volume of history provides the reader with a keen sense of perspective and a genuine appreciation of the past. This is exactly what David S. Reynolds does in <b>Waking Giant: America in the Age of Jackson</b>, which authoritatively describes the early to middle part of the American 19th Century and makes clear how important this period was to the nation's growth in sociocultural, industrial and political terms....The marvel here is how Reynolds tackles textbook material with a great deal of stylish and involving writing."<br> -- <i>BookPage</i></p><p>David S. Reynolds is Distinguished Professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. His books include <em>John Brown</em>, <em>Abolitionist</em>, winner of the Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award; <em>Walt Whitman's America</em>, winner of the Bancroft Prize and the Ambassador Book Award and a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; and <em>Beneath the American Renaissance</em>, winner of the Christian Gauss Award from the Phi Beta Kappa Society.

This question was most fractious in the border states of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. In Missouri, it was largely settled at Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861, in a contest that is rightly considered the second major battle of the Civil War.<br><br>In providing the first in-depth narrative and analysis of this important but largely overlooked battle, William Piston and Richard Hatcher combine a traditional military study of the fighting at Wilson's Creek with an innovative social analysis of the soldiers who participated and the communities that supported them. In particular, they highlight the importance of the soldiers' sense of corporate honor--the desire to uphold the reputation of their hometowns--as a powerful motivator for enlistment, a source of sustenance during the campaign, and a lens through which soldiers evaluated their performance in battle.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"Piston and Hatcher have successfully mined local newspapers and veterans' letters and recollections to show the drama and poignancy of men on both sides marching off to a war whose parameters they could not fully comprehend. . . . [They] have captured well the pathos of the early months of the war as it affected those who fought it."-- <i>Journal of Southern History</i> <br>The only full treatment of Wilson&#39;s Creek (8/10/1861), the second major battle of the Civil War and a determining factor in Missouri&#39;s decision to remain in the Union. This book combines a detailed military study with a close look at the men who fought there, exploring their ideals and fears and their determination to uphold, at all costs, the honor of their home commuinities in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Texas, and Iowa.</p><h2>Superman Vol. 7: Bizarroverse</h2><p><b>The saga of Superman's strangest foe is about to get a little stranger!

In this important new work, Robinson critiques ideas of black identity constructed through a northern lens and situates African Americans as central shapers of contemporary southern culture. Analytically separating black southerners from their migrating cousins, fictive kin, and white counterparts, Robinson demonstrates how place intersects with race, class, gender, and regional identities and differences.<br><br>Robinson grounds her work in Memphis--the first big city heading north out of the Mississippi Delta. Although Memphis sheds light on much about the South, Robinson does not suggest that the region is monolithic. Instead, she attends to multiple Souths, noting the distinctions between southern places. Memphis, neither Old South nor New South, sits at the intersections of rural and urban, soul and post-soul, and civil rights and post-civil rights, representing an ongoing conversation with the varied incarnations of the South, past and present.<br><br></p><p>" <i>This Ain't Chicago</i> is a fascinating exploration of the shifting contours of racial and regional identity in the post-civil rights era. Robinson shows that southern regional identity and culture provide insights into understanding something about cities and 'urban change.' The book offers a bridge between the worlds of southern studies, cultural studies, and urban theory."--Bruce Haynes, University of California, Davis <br>Zandria F.

Keller received her PhD in biophysical chemistry from the University of New Mexico in 1992. She was then awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

Abraham attempts to address the dearth of modern theology on the topic of evangelism. In contrast both to the traditional focus on proclamation and to the more recent emphasis on church growth, Abraham argues that evangelism should be construed as primary initiation into the kingdom of God. / Fleshing out his thesis by discussing how conversion, baptism, morality, the creed, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the classical spiritual disciplines are related to kingdom initiation, Abraham seeks to articulate the implications of his theory of evangelism for the practice of evangelism. / Besides holding forth a specific norm regarding how evangelism should be understood, Abraham also maintains that the sorely needed critical discussion about evangelism should proceed in a particular way&#x2014;not by drawing up new, specialized schemes but rather by bringing to bear on the topic relevant material from a number of appropriate disciplines. The book thus seeks to provoke or inspire other scholars to pursue critical reflection on evangelism, to further develop the new ground broken here.</p><p>William J. Abraham is Albert Cook Outler Professor of Theology and Wesley Studies at Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University. His other books include Canon and Criterion in Christian Theology: From the Fathers to Feminism (Oxford).Abraham (Perkins School of Theology) subjects the theory and practice of evangelism to modern theological reflection. He points out that very little critical theological thought has been applied to this area and that no major contemporary theologian has written about it. In an attempt to foster such serious study, Abraham takes a logical and scholarly approach, defining evangelism as "primary initiative into the Kingdom of God" as opposed to "preaching the Gospel" or "church growth." After developing his thesis in the first five chapters, he then examines the relation to evangelism of conversion, baptism, spiritual gifts, and related topics. Practical evangelism and ecumenism are also discussed. An excellent and scholarly work long overdue in the field. Recommended for large public and academic libraries.

One or two simple sentences briefly describe each stage of development from the time the animal hatches until it lays eggs of its own. A bit of drama is introduced when the creatures encounter humankind. In Spider, the protagonist barely escapes being sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and on the last page it is shown dangling on a strand of spider silk over the open mouth of a sleeping child. In Butterfly, a migration flight is interrupted when it is caught and then released by a child with a net. A foreword provides the scientific name of the species and miscellaneous facts about its behavior, life span, etc. Each title has a clearly written and logically organized text, but it is the attractive format and cleverly composed illustrations that young readers will most enjoy. Each painting is framed by a triple border with assorted body parts escaping onto the margins, giving the pictures a three-dimensional effect. Gail Gibbons's Monarch Butterfly (1989) and Spiders (1993, both Holiday) provide more detailed information on anatomy, physical and behavioral characteristics, etc. Faith McNulty's Lady and the Spider (HarperCollins, 1986) has a more engrossing story line.

Within its boundaries, the French Revolution was plotted, the guillotine invented, and in 1968 students revolted and clashed with police. Philosopher Descartes is buried here (sans skull), while Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir birthed existentialism around the tables of the legendary Cafe de Flore. Saint-Germain sheltered and inspired such artistic rebels as Picasso, Rimbaud, Hemingway, and scores of jazz musicians. Today, the neighborhood, with its cobblestone streets, iconic cafes, and unique shopping destinations, is one of Paris's premier tourist attractions. And yet it retains its rebel soul&#x2014;if you know where to look.</p><p>In this first book in his "Great Parisian Neighborhoods" series, Baxter, an expat who has called Saint-Germain home for more than two decades, guides readers on an off-the-beaten-path journey through the quarter's history, landmarks, and delights.</p></p><p><p>John Baxter has lived in Paris for more than twenty years. He is the author of four acclaimed memoirs about his life in France: <em>The Perfect Meal: In Search of the Lost Tastes of France</em>; <em>The Most Beautiful Walk in the World: A Pedestrian in Paris</em>; <em>Immoveable Feast: A Paris Christmas</em>; and <em>We'll Always Have Paris: Sex and Love in the City of Light</em>. Baxter, who gives literary walking tours through Paris, is also a film critic and biographer whose subjects have included the directors Fellini, Kubrick, Woody Allen, and most recently, Josef von Sternberg. Born in Australia, he lives with his wife and daughter in the Saint-Germain-des-Pr�s neighborhood, in the same building Sylvia Beach called home.</p>&#x201c;John Baxter and his incredible knowledge made me feel like I was walking through history. Anyone who reads this book will experience the artists, writers, and beauty of Paris come to life as if they were standing on the streets of St. Germain themselves.&#x201d; (Maria Bello, actress and author of <i>Whatever... Love is Love</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Another delightful salute to Paris. ... Whether you&#x2019;re planning your first trip to Paris or absolutely have to stop in Paris on your way anywhere, this book, in addition to the author&#x2019;s previous guides, is essential.&#x201d; (Kirkus Reviews <strong>(starred review)</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Saint-Germain-des-Pr�s embodies so much of what makes Paris special. ... It&#x2019;s precisely this fascinating history that John Baxter has brought to life. ... Baxter is without question a good man to tell the story of one of the City of Light&#x2019;s most iconic quarters.&#x201d; (World Traveller)<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to know what has made Saint-Germain-des-Pr�s so special, read this captivating account.

Certainly chance or dumb luck sometimes leads us straight to a record kept in an improbable place, to an ancestor&#39;s second wife we didn&#39;t know anything about, and so on. Is it luck? Coincidence? In this book, esteemed genealogist Hank Jones tells us about his own brushes with preternatural experiences, and he has invited other genealogists to share their experiences as well; thus in these pages we have the insights of well over a hundred respected ancestor hunters who discuss their experiences in light of synchronicity, intuition, genetic memory, and serendipity. Their stories fairly crackle with illumination and make a plausible case for the importance of the sixth sense in genealogical research.</p><p></p><h2>Home at Rose Cottage: Three Down the AisleWhat&#39;s Cooking?

It was like a neglected doll's cottage, abandoned by a fickle child who'd moved on to other toys. The screens on the side porch had been torn by vandals, the front steps sagged, the paint was peeling. One dangling shutter slapped against the side of the house whenever there was any sort of breeze.<br><br>The house sat on a valuable piece of property that backed up to the Chesapeake Bay. From the road, the view was all but invisible thanks to the overgrown grass and shrubbery, but it had to be incredible. That anyone could abandon such a place and leave it to the elements to be destroyed was a crime. If they weren't going to use it, they should sell to someone who'd take proper care of it.<br><br>But if the sorry state of the house bothered Mike, it was the garden that made him want to leap from the car with his pruning shears, rakes and shovels. Landscape design was his passion, and he could tell that once upon a time, this place had been a garden showcase. Someone had nurtured the roses that struggled to bloom there now.<br><br>Someone had given thought to the placement of the lilacs right beneath the windows where the fragrance would drift in on a spring morning.<br><br>Now, though, the roses were out of control, tangled with thorny vines. Honeysuckle had taken over the lilacs. The paint on the picket fence was peeling, and parts of it were close to collapse under the weight of the untamed bushes. A few perennials continued to struggle against the weeds, but the weeds were winning. It made him heartsick to see it all gone to ruin.<br><br>He'd wanted to buy it himself at first sight six years ago, but the real estate agent said the owner wasn't interested in selling. Apparently the owner wasn't interested in anything having to do with the house, either.<br><br>"Daddy," Jessie piped up from beside him. "Why are we stopping here? This place is scary."<br><br>Mike glanced over at his six-year-old daughter, who, at the moment, looked like a Victorian painting of a blue-eyed, blond-haired angel. There were no smudges on her cheeks, no tangles in her hair, no rips in her clothes. In fact, she was having a good morning so far. There had been no tantrums over which dress to put on, no battles over the scrambled eggs he'd set in front of her for breakfast because they were out of Cheerios. Days like this were so rare, Mike had learned to cherish them when they came.<br><br>Not that he would trade one single second of the time he spent with her, tantrums or not. Jessie was his precious girl, his little survivor. She'd been through way too much in her young life. She'd been born addicted to the drugs her mother hadn't been able to quit, drugs Mike hadn't even realized Linda was hiding from him. When doctors at the hospital had told him his irritable, underweight baby girl was going through withdrawal, he'd been stunned.<br><br>He'd spent the next six months after that battling with Linda, trying to get her into rehab, trying to make her see that she was destroying not only her own life and their marriage, but their daughter's life, as well. Unfortunately, nothing he'd said had gotten through to her. The drugs were far more powerful, far more alluring than his love or the needs of their baby girl.<br><br>Finally, filled with despair, he'd gone to court, gotten his divorce and full custody of Jessie, and left. Linda's folks knew where to find them, if Linda ever got her act together and wanted to see her child. Until then, though, Linda was out of their lives.<br><br>Linda's heartsick parents had agreed that he had no choice. That, at least, had given him some comfort, knowing they believed he'd done what he'd had to do. They visited regularly, but Linda's name was rarely mentioned, especially in front of Jessie. Now that she was old enough to understand, when she asked the inevitable questions about her mother, Mike answered as honestly as he could, but it broke his heart to see the hurt in Jessie's eyes.<br><br>Being a single dad would have been hard under any circumstances, but dealing with Jessie's lingering behavior problems was enough to test the patience of a saint. As a baby, she'd screamed her dissatisfaction night and day. Now she was simply unpredictable, sunny one minute and hysterical the next.<br><br>Most days Mike was up to the task of dealing with her mood swings, but there were times when it was all he could do not to break down in exhaustion and weep for the damage that had been done to his beautiful little girl.<br><br>That was one reason he'd chosen the small town of Irvington on the Chesapeake Bay. There was plenty of work to be had here, but the pace was slower and less<br><br>demanding than it would have been in a major city. If he needed to spend extra time with Jessie, he could do so without feeling he was shortchanging his clients. And, because his reputation was excellent, he could pick and choose among those who sought his services, making sure that each of them understood that Jessie would always be his first priority.<br><br>"We need to go <em>now!</em>" Jessie commanded. Even at six, she had the imperial presence of a queen commanding her subjects. She lowered her voice and confided, "I think ghosts live here, Daddy."<br><br>Mike grinned at her. It wasn't the first time she'd expressed a negative opinion about the rundown place, but the addition of a ghost was something new. "What makes you think that, pumpkin?" he asked.<br><br>"Something moved at the window. I saw it." Her lower lip trembled, and panic filled her eyes.<br><br>"Nobody lives here," Mike reassured her. "The house is empty."<br><br>"Something moved," Jessie said stubbornly, clearly near tears. Whether she'd actually seen something or not, her fear was real. "We need to <em>go!</em>"<br><br>Rather than argue, Mike accelerated and continued on to the school. Any logical response he could have made would only have escalated the tension, and the rare serenity would have been shattered.<br><br>As soon as they were away from the house, Jessie's shoulders eased and she gave him a tremulous smile. "We're safe now," she said happily.<br><br>"You're always safe when I'm around," Mike reminded her.<br><br>"I know, Daddy," she said patiently. "But I don't like that place. I don't want to go there again. Not ever. Promise."<br><br>"We have to drive by it every day," Mike said.<br><br>"But only really, really fast," Jessie insisted. "Okay?"<br><br>Mike sighed, knowing that reasoning with his daughter when she was like this was a waste of breath. "Okay."<br><br>"Have a good day, pumpkin," he said a few minutes later when he left Jessie at the front door of the school. "I'll be right here when you get out this afternoon."<br><br>He'd discovered early on that she needed to be reassured again and again that he would be back, that he wouldn't forget about her. The psychologist he'd spoken to said Jessie's need for constant reassurance was yet another effect of not having her mother in her life, of knowing that Linda had abandoned her. Some days he wondered if he shouldn't have lied and said Linda was dead, if that wouldn't have been less cruel, but he hadn't been able to bring himself to do it. Maybe he'd naively held out hope that someday Linda would straighten herself out and want to be a part of their daughter's life.<br><br>"Bye, Daddy." Jessie turned away, then looked back at him, her expression filled with worry. "You won't go back to the bad house, will you? I don't want the ghost to get you."<br><br>"No ghost is going to get me," Mike promised, sketching a cross over his heart in the way he always did to reassure her that he meant what he said. "I wear ghost repellent."<br><br>Jessie giggled. "You're silly," she told him, though genuine relief flashed in her eyes.<br><br>Then she was gone, racing to catch up with a friend. Mike stared after her, wishing it could always be this easy to calm her fears. Some nights there was no consoling her. Some nights she had nightmares she refused to describe, calming only when he held her.<br><br>When Jessie was finally out of sight, he turned on his heel and went back to the car, already planning his jam-packed schedule for the few hours till school let out again.<br><br>But instead of heading toward the job he had landscaping a newly completed house overlooking the bay, he drove back to the Lindsey place, drawn by something he couldn't quite explain.<br><br>Had Jessie actually seen something move? Or was he simply reacting to her too-vivid imagination, caught up in the mystery of the deserted house that had fascinated him from the moment he'd arrived in town? Whichever it was, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to put his mind at rest and satisfy his curiosity. Maybe then he'd be able to put his mild obsession with the place behind him once and for all.<br><br>Melanie was standing in her grandmother's kitchen ineffectively battling cobwebs, when the front gate creaked, sending her already jittery nerves into a full-blown panic attack.<br><br>Only a few minutes earlier she'd thought she heard a car stop on the isolated road, but when she'd peeked through the curtain of her upstairs bedroom, she'd seen only a glimpse of sun on metal before hearing the car drive on. The incident, which would have been commonplace enough in Boston, had been oddly disconcerting here.<br><br>With her heart pumping and her pulse racing once more, she crept into the living room and edged toward the window she'd thrown open to let in the cool spring breeze.<br><br>"What the hell?"<br><br>The very male voice just outside had her plastering her back to the wall, even as her heart ricocheted wildly.<br><br>"Anybody here?" the man shouted, rattling the doorknob.<br><br>This wasn't good, not good at all, Melanie decided. Her cell phone was across the room, just more proof that she wasn't thinking clearly of late. Even with all the recent development she'd noticed as she drove in, the nearest neighbor was a quarter-mile up the road. There were a few boats on the bay this morning and sound did carry near water, but would anyone get here in time even if she shouted for help?<br><br>She tried to think what Ashley would do. Her fearless big sister would probably have a firm grip on a lamp by now and be in attack mode by the door. Picturing it, Melanie reached for the closest lamp with its heavy marble base and tested its weight. This sucker could do some real damage, she concluded, suddenly feeling more confident and in control.<br><br>"Who's there?" she shouted back in what she hoped was a suitably indignant tone. "You're trespassing."<br><br>"So are you."<br><br>She was so taken aback by the outrageous accusation that she swung open the door and scowled at the interloper. It was amazing how much braver she felt with that lamp and a little indignation on her side.<br><br>"I most certainly am not trespassing," she said again, trying not to let her voice waver at the sight of the hulking man on the threshold.<br><br>At least six-two and easily two hundred pounds, he was all muscle and sinew. Even though it was barely April, his skin had already been burnished gold by the sun, and his dark brown hair had fiery highlights in it. His T-shirt stretched tightly over a massive chest, and his faded jeans hugged impressive thighs. An illustration of Paul Bunyon immediately came to mind.<br><br>At any other time in her life, she might have been more appreciative of such a gorgeous male specimen, but in recent days anything driven by testosterone was the enemy. That didn't seem to stop her heartbeat from skipping merrily at the sight of him. Given his obviously sour mood, her instinctive response was doubly annoying.<br><br>"Cornelia Lindsey is dead," he announced, his blue eyes steady and unrelenting as he challenged her to dispute that.<br><br>"I know," Melanie said. "She was my grandmother. She died seven years ago this month."<br><br>He nodded slowly. "You've got that much right. You're a Lindsey?"<br><br>"Actually I'm a D'Angelo. Melanie D'Angelo. My mother was a Lindsey until she married my father."<br><br>"Cornelia Lindsey was Southern through and through, according to the neighbors. You don't sound like you're from around here."<br><br>"I'm not. I'm from Boston."<br><br>"You have any ID? "<br><br>She regarded him with a mix of amusement and defensiveness. "None with my family tree printed on it. Who <em>are </em>you? The local sheriff or something?"<br><br>"Just a neighbor. This place has been empty a long time. Someone turns up out of the blue like this, I just want to be sure they belong here. If you are who you say you are, I'm sure you can appreciate that."<br><br>It was evident to Melanie that he wasn't going to budge without some sort of proof that she wasn't a stranger setting up housekeeping in an abandoned property. He was right. She ought to be grateful that a neighbor would take such interest in making sure the cottage was secure.<br><br>"Stay there," she muttered, then stared at the lamp she still held clutched in her hands. She set it back on its table, then crossed the room to grab her purse and several of the framed snapshots sitting on the old oak sideboard.<br><br>When she returned, she handed him her driver's license, then a photo of a grinning girl with freckles and hair bleached almost white by the sun. "That's me at six," she said, then showed him the rest. "My sisters, Maggie, Ashley and Jo with our mom. And this one is of all of us with my grandmother, Cornelia Lindsey, just before she died. Did you know her?"<br><br>"No," he said, taking the photo and studying it intently.<br><br>To her surprise, he barely spared a glance for her sisters, all of them long-legged beauties. Instead, his gaze seemed to be focused on something else in the picture.<br><br>"I knew it," he mumbled, then scowled at her. "You all should be ashamed of yourselves."<br><br>She flinched at the outrage in his tone. "I beg your pardon!"<br><br>"The garden," he said impatiently. "You've let it go to ruin."<br><br>Melanie sighed. She could hardly deny it was a disgrace. She'd all but had to chop her way through it to get inside. She was pretty sure her car was likely to be swallowed up by aggressive vines if she didn't move it on a regular basis.<br><br>"I noticed," she conceded mildly.<br><br></p><h2>God is in the City: Encounters of Grace and Transformation</h2><p>God is in the City is an inspiring collection of stories that will transform the way you see God and the city.

David Kinsley's new book documents a highly unusual group of ten Hindu tantric goddesses, the Mahavidyas, many of whom are strongly associated with sexuality and violence. What is one to make of a goddess who cuts her own head off, or one who prefers sex with a corpse? The Mahavidyas embody habits, attributes, or identities usually considered repulsive or socially subversive and can be viewed as "antimodels" for women. Yet it is within the context of tantric worship that devotees seek to identify themselves with these forbidding goddesses. The Mahavidyas seem to function as "awakeners"&#x2015;symbols which help to project one's consciousness beyond the socially acceptable or predictable.<br><br>Drawing on a broad range of Sanskrit and vernacular texts as well as extensive research in India, including written and oral interpretations of contemporary Hindu practitioners, Kinsley describes the unusual qualities of each of the Mahavidyas and traces the parallels between their underlying themes. Especially valuable are the many rare and fascinating images he presents&#x2015;each important to grasping the significance of the goddesses. Written in an accessible, engaging style, Kinsley's book provides a comprehensive understanding of the Mahavidyas and is also an overview of Hindu tantric practice.</p><p>"A far-ranging and impressively comprehensive book with exemplary iconographic analyses.

Still, few of us could identify all of our daily and festal ritual behaviors, much less explain them to an outsider. Similarly, because of the variety of activities that qualify as ritual and their many contradictory yet, in many ways, equally legitimate interpretations, ritual seems to elude any systematic historical and comparative scrutiny. In this book, Catherine Bell offers a practical introduction to ritual practice and its study; she surveys the most influential theories of religion and ritual, the major categories of ritual activity, and the key debates that have shaped our understanding of ritualism. Bell refuses to nail down ritual with any one definition or understanding. Instead, her purpose is to reveal how definitions emerge and evolve and to help us become more familiar with the interplay of tradition, exigency, and self- expression that goes into constructing this complex social medium.<br></p><p><br>Former Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies, Santa Clara University<br><br>"A very impressive achievement....[Bell's] is one of the most interesting and important voices in the field of ritual studies today."--<em>Worship</em> <br><p></p><br>"A rich and detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the nature and functions of ritual.

How have they studied it in the past? How do we study religion today? Is the academic study of religion the same as religious education? These and many other questions are addressed in this engaging introduction to the discipline of religious studies, written by two experienced university teachers. The authors have crafted this book to familiarize novice students with key concepts and terminology in the study of religion. More advanced students will find a varied array of theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches to the field. Topics include: </p> <ul> <li>definitions of religion </li> <li>perspectives in the study and teaching of religion </li> <li>how religion began to be studied: traditional perspectives &#x2013; philosophical and theological</li> <li>how people experience religion: perspectives in the study of religious consciousness and perception &#x2013; phenomenological and psychological </li> <li>studying religion within communities: Social and cultural perspectives &#x2013; anthropological, sociological, political and economic </li> <li>judging religion: critical perspectives &#x2013;feminist approaches, the interaction of popular literature and religion</li> <li>contextual perspectives &#x2013; historical and comparative.</li></ul> <p>The book encourages students to think critically about the theories and methods presented.

Not only is it the earliest existing play in the Western tradition, it is drawn directly from the playwright's own experiences at the battle of Salamis, making it the only account of the Persian Wars composed by an eyewitness. And as pure tragedy, it is a masterpiece. Aeschylus tells the story of the war from the Persian point of view, and his pride in the great victory of Greeks is tempered with a real compassion for Xerxes and his vanquished nation. Lembke and Harrington have rendered this stunning work in a modern translation that loses none of the original's dramatic juxtaposition of serenity and violence, hope and despair.<br></p><p>Based on the conviction that only translator who write poetry themselves can properly recreate the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the poetry of the originals.<br><strong>Janet Lembke</strong>, a poet, is the author of <em>Bronze and Iron</em>, and is co-translator of the forthcoming edition of Euripides's <em>Suppliants</em>, also in the <em>Greek Tragedy in New Translations</em> series.<br><strong>C.

The medieval Norsemen may be best remembered as monk murderers and village pillagers, but this is far from the whole story. Throughout the Middle Ages, long-ships transported hairy northern voyagers far and wide, where they not only raided but also traded, explored and settled new lands, encountered unfamiliar races, and embarked on pilgrimages and crusades.<br><br>The Norsemen travelled to all corners of the medieval world and beyond; north to the wastelands of arctic Scandinavia, south to the politically turbulent heartlands of medieval Christendom, west across the wild seas to Greenland and the fringes of the North American continent, and east down the Russian waterways trading silver, skins, and slaves. <em>Beyond the Northlands</em> explores this world through the stories that the Vikings told about themselves in their sagas. <br><br>But the depiction of the Viking world in the Old Norse-Icelandic sagas goes far beyond historical facts. What emerges from these tales is a mixture of realism and fantasy, quasi-historical adventures, and exotic wonder-tales that rocket far beyond the horizon of reality. On the crackling brown pages of saga manuscripts, trolls, dragons, and outlandish tribes jostle for position with explorers, traders, and kings. <br><br>To explore the sagas and the world that produced them, Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough now takes her own trip through the dramatic landscapes that they describe. Along the way, she illuminates the rich but often confusing saga accounts with a range of other evidence: archaeological finds, rune-stones, medieval world maps, encyclopaedic manuscripts, and texts from as far away as Byzantium and Baghdad. As her journey across the Old Norse world shows, by situating the sagas against the revealing background of this other evidence, we can begin at least to understand just how the world was experienced, remembered, and imagined by this unique culture from the outermost edge of Europe so many centuries ago.<br></p><p><br><strong>Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough</strong> is Assistant Professor in Medieval History and Literature at Durham University. In 2013, she was chosen as one of ten BBC Radio 3 New Generation Thinkers, in a competition to find young academics with the potential to turn their research into programmes for broadcast. Eleanor's research often takes her to the chilly Nordic climes of Scandinavia, Iceland, and Greenland. Whilst researching this book, Eleanor had many far-flung adventures of her own: bumping along on the back of an Icelandic horse whilst exploring Norse ruins in Greenland, sailing ice fjords under the midnight sun with a caribou hunter, and searching for Norse rune-stones in Sweden. Her proudest moment came when travelling across Arctic Norway, where she was knighted with a walrus penis bone in Hammerfest and became a member of the Royal and Ancient Polar Bear Society.<br><br>"With a clever and engaging style, the author marries interpretations of Norse sagas with historical references, creating a detailed analysis of Viking evolution and worldview with clarity, humor, and a sense of relevance...

This book connects legal studies to the study of society in two different senses.<br><br>First, the readings highlight law's responsiveness to various dimensions of social stratification. They also draw attention to the questions of when, why, and how legal decisions and actions respond to the social characteristics (e.g. race, class, and gender) of those making the decisions as well as those who are subject to them. These questions inevitably raise issues of justice and fairness, highlighting the moral dimensions of legal life.<br><br>Second, Sarat treats law itself as a social organization, emphasizing the complex relations between its various component parts (e.g., judges and jurors, police and prosecutors, appellate courts, and trial courts). The book examines the traditional subject of professional legal study--namely appellate court opinions--and describes some of the most pressing controversies of legal interpretation while questioning how those opinions take on meaning in social life. Sarat also questions whether those at the top of law's bureaucratic structure effectively control the behavior of others in the legal system's chain of command.<br><br>This anthology provides accessible, up-to-date materials (such as readings on terrorism and the challenges it poses to law, racial profiling, and gay rights) juxtaposed to the classics of the field.

The game is set in Rome in the early decades of the seventeenth century. Most of the debates occur within the Holy Office, the arm of the papacy that supervises the Roman Inquisition. At times action shifts to the palace of Prince Cesi, founder of the Society of the Lynx-Eyed, which promotes the new science, and to the lecture halls of the Jesuit Collegio Romano. Some students assume roles as faculty of the Collegio Romano and the secular University of Rome, the Sapienza. Others are Cardinals who seek to defend the faith from resurgent Protestantism, the imperial ambitions of the Spanish monarch, the schemes of the Medici in Florence, and the crisis of faith throughout Christendom. Some embrace the &#x201c;new cosmology,&#x201d; some denounce it, and still others are undecided. The issues range from the nature of faith and the meaning of the Bible to the scientific principles and methods as advanced by Copernicus, Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Giordano Bruno, and Galileo. Central texts include Aristotle&#x2019;s <em>On the Heavens</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>; Galileo&#x2019;s <em>Starry Messenger</em> (1610), Letter to Grand Duchess Christina (1615) and <em>Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems</em> (1632); the declarations of the Council of Trent; and the Bible.<br><br><em>Reacting to the Past</em> is a series of historical role-playing games that explore important ideas by re-creating the contexts that shaped them. Students are assigned roles, informed by classic texts, set in particular moments of intellectual and social ferment.<br><br> An award-winning active-learning pedagogy, <em>Reacting to the Past</em> improves speaking, writing, and leadership skills, promotes engagement with classic texts and history, and builds learning communities. <em>Reacting</em> can be used across the curriculum, from the first-year general education class to &#x201c;capstone&#x201d; experiences.

The author, a feminist anthropologist, uses three texts developed out of her research in Taiwan&#x2015;a piece of fiction, anthropological fieldnotes, and a social science article&#x2015;to explore some of these criticisms.<br>Each text takes a different perspective, is written in a different style, and has different "outcomes," yet all three involve the same fascinating set of events. A young mother began to behave in a decidedly abherrant, perhaps suicidal manner, and opinion in her village was sharply divided over the reason. Was she becoming a shaman, posessed by a god? Was she deranged, in need of physical restraint, drugs, and hospitalization? Or was she being cynically manipulated by her ne'er-do-well husband to elicit sympathy and money from her neighbors? In the end, the woman was taken away from the area to her mother's house. For some villagers, this settled the matter; for others the debate over her behavior was probably never truly resolved.<br>The first text is a short story written shortly after the incident, which occurred almost thrity years ago; the second text is a copy of the fieldnotes collected about the events covered in the short story; the third text is an article published in 1990 in <i>American Ethnologist</i> that analyzes the incident from the author's current perspective. Following each text is a Commentary in which the author discusses such topics as experimental ethnography, polyvocality, authorial presence and control, reflexivity, and some of the differences between fiction and ethnography.<br>The three texts are framed by two chapters in which the author discusses the genereal problems posed by feminist and postmodernist critics of ethnography and presents her personal exploration of these issues in an argument that is strongly self-reflexive and theoretically rigorous. She considers some feminist concerns over colonial research methods and takes issues with the insistence of some feminists tha the topics of ethnographic research be set by those who are studied. The book concludes with a plea for ethnographic responsibility based on a less academic and more practical perspective.</p><p>&#x201c;A Thrice-Told Tale provides enjoyable fiction, important glimpses of fieldwork methodology, first-rate feminist analysis, and stimulating polemic. It can be used with students&#x2014;of history, women&#x2019;s studies and other fields in addition to anthropology.&#x201d;&#x2014;Journal of Oriental Studies</p><h2>Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television</h2><p>Based on the classic <em>History of Broadcasting in the United States</em>, <em>Tube of Plenty</em> represents the fruit of several decades' labor. When Erik Barnouw--premier chronicler of American broadcasting and a participant in the industry for fifty years--first undertook the project of recording its history, many viewed it as a light-weight literary task concerned mainly with "entertainment" trivia. Indeed, trivia such as that found in quiz programs do appear in the book, but Barnouw views them as part of a complex social tapestry that increasingly defines our era.<br> To understand our century, we must fully comprehend the evolution of television and its newest extraordinary offshoots. With this fact in mind, Barnouw's new edition of <em>Tube of Plenty</em> explores the development and impact of the latest dramatic phases of the communications revolution.<br> Since the first publication of this invaluable history of television and how it has shaped, and been shaped by, American culture and society, many significant changes have occurred. Assessing the importance of these developments in a new chapter, Barnouw specifically covers the decline of the three major networks, the expansion of cable and satellite television and film channels such as HBO (Home Box Office), the success of channels catering to special audiences such as ESPN (Entertainment and Sports Programming Network) and MTV (Music Television), and the arrival of VCRs in America's living rooms. He also includes an appendix entitled "questions for a new millennium," which will challenge readers not only to examine the shape of television today, but also to envision its future.<br></p><p><br><strong>Erik Barnouw</strong>, Professor Emeritus of Dramatic Arts at Columbia University, co-founded and chaired Columbia's Film Division for many years.

The final chapter has been revised to cover business practices for finding employment or successful self-employment.</p><p>Mark Beck had been a Milady author since the first publication of The Theory and Practice of Therapeutic Massage in 1988. Mark began his professional career as a massage therapist in 1974. He started teaching massage in 1978 and became a massage school owner and director in 1980. As school director for over 15 years, he developed curriculum, taught classes and continued a part time clinical practice. He served on the boards of a state and a national massage organization in different capacities including sec. of education, sec. of certification and president. In 1996 he earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in Vocational Education with an emphasis on massage therapy from the University of Idaho. A skiing accident in 1990 resulted in a C-6 spinal cord injury that landed Mark in a wheelchair with quadriplegia. That ended his active practice as a massage therapist but did not quell his dedication to the profession or his desire to provide the best possible information to thousands of students entering the profession by continually updating and refining The Theory and Practice of Therapeutic Massage. Mark continued to be an advocate for excellence in massage education and accessibility for the disabled until he sadly passed away in November 2016."The Beck textbook is filled with an incredible amount of knowledge for the up and coming massage therapist.

His books have received rave reviews, won several awards including the Ben Franklin Award for Best Mystery of the year, and made several bestseller lists.KIrkus Reviews:<br><br>A California private investigator and his Great Dane explore the seamy underside of charities. Philosophical sleuth Owen McKenna, aided largely by his dog, Spot, returns in this 15th volume of Borg's (Tahoe Dark, 2016, etc.) mystery/thriller series. When the novel opens, Owen already has a personal case on his plate. His girlfriend, scientific researcher Street Casey, is being stalked by her father, Tom, who has threatened to kill her for her testimony, which sent him to prison for a long stretch. Street has refused Owen's proffered protection, choosing instead to continue living on her own while learning self-defense techniques from him. But, having to pay the bills, Owen gets drawn into a new case involving charity scammers. The client is Douglas Fairbanks, whose parents obviously had a nasty sense of humor. The introverted, middle-aged millionaire wants Owen to find his missing, much-younger girlfriend, Isadore. The two get off to a rocky start when Owen questions Isadore's motives: "You are suggesting that the love of my life is a con artist, a thief?" Fairbanks asks. Owen's instincts prove correct after Isadora is found gruesomely murdered, as he discovers she earned millions off a fake charity. Soon three others connected to charity scams are similarly slain, and Owen is hunting a serial killer. All the while, he is preoccupied by the threat to Street. In Owen, a former San Francisco homicide detective, Borg has created a winning protagonist, both forthright and pragmatic. It's a treat to see how his mind works. Owen has a dedicated partner in Spot, whom he has trained as both a search and an attack dog and who becomes a central figure in this installment. More problematic is the damaged Street, whom Owen struggles to protect while respecting her wishes. The author has provided a diverse group of believable suspects, including the son of a charity's mark, a disabled artist, a forgetful scientist, and even Owen's own client. Borg effectively sets all this action against the colorful backdrop of Tahoe and its visitors and citizens. The result is an engrossing whodunit that should keep readers guessing through the final twist. <br>A worthy addition to a well-devised mystery/thriller series. - Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>Cthulhu 2000: Stories</h2><p>A host of horror and fantasy&#x2019;s top authors captures the spirit of supreme supernatural storyteller H.

Fuji, by Hokusai&#x201d; by Roger Zelazny</p><p>Editor Jim Turner has compiled a real page turner in <i>Cthulhu 2000</i>. His anthology of short stories based on the works of horrorist H.P. Lovecraft is a dark gem, and of superior stuff. Although they all have the coppery tang of the eldritch, the tales aren't strictly in the horror mien. Some of them are an alloy of horror with a sci-fi, humor, detective, vampire or even romance slant.<p> The very best are truly horrible, in the most complimentary sense of that word. "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood" (Poppy Z. Brite), "The Adder" (Fred Chappell), "Fat Face" (Michael Shea), "The Unthinkable" (Bruce Sterling), "Love's Eldritch Ichor" (Esther M. Friesner) and "On the Slab" (Harlan Ellison) are the keen standouts, but all the rest, practically, are of almost equal quality. However, there are a couple of tales that do not deserve to be amongst this company, and the tome would have been better and tighter by their absence. Certainly, at 398 pages, there's no lack of material. </p><p> In "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood," Poppy Z. Brite deftly invokes a vampric flavor to themes of decay and the forbidden, his writing style as ornate and refined as rococo and in the real spirit of the master. Fred Chappell's "The Adder" draws the dangerous and inimical from the ordinary in a tale delightful for its originality. Bruce Sterling also slings some fresh ideas around in "The Unthinkable," melding modernity and necromancy in a brief, effective story.</p><p> Horror gourmands will find a good meal here, but <i>Cthulhu 2000</i> should have a bit of life outside its traditional genre, for the writing is strong, imaginative and entertaining. <i>--Tamara Hladik</i></p>Cthulhu 2000<br> &nbsp;<br> 1.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a career as editor of Arkham House that has lasted now for twenty years, I have received a certain type of letter&#x2014;over and over and over again&#x2014;arriving from all parts of the world. The correspondent is usually, though not invariably, a young man, but the message is always the same: I have just encountered H.P. Lovecraft, and golly! what a writer. Here is a fairly recent example from a student in Greece, and please recall that what follows is the unemended transcript of someone using English as a foreign language:<br> &nbsp;<br> In the early 80&#x2019;s a Hellenic publishing house&nbsp;...&nbsp;released a book that consisted of stories of various authors. One of them was meant to become an everlasting influence and inspiration for my humble self. His initials were H.P.L. Since then fiction, imaginary landscapes, supernatural and cosmic horror entertain my lonely hours....<br> &nbsp;<br> Why is it, one wonders, that a reclusive writer of weird-fantasy stories, who during his lifetime couldn&#x2019;t even earn a decent living, now possesses the power to inspire, and even to affect the lives of, readers around the globe?<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the past half century, Lovecraft has emerged as a classic exponent of the weird-fantasy narrative, and as a general principle, there is only one acceptable type of such a story: a great one. Either a weird tale overwhelms the reader with what Lovecraft termed &#x201c;the strange reality of the unreal&#x201d; (in which case weaknesses are irrelevant), or it doesn&#x2019;t (in which case strengths are irrelevant). To reiterate Lovecraft&#x2019;s weaknesses at this point would be gratuitous, for his technical shortcomings are apparent to even the most insensitive reader; one may as well complain that the Venus de Milo has no arms. What then are Lovecraft&#x2019;s positive qualities to account for his sorcerous hold upon readers the world over?<br> &nbsp;<br> In his 1932 essay &#x201c;Notes on Writing Weird Fiction,&#x201d; Lovecraft establishes at the outset the creative criteria for his craft: &#x201c;My reason for writing stories is to give myself the satisfaction of visualising more clearly and detailedly and stably the vague, elusive, fragmentary impressions of wonder, beauty, and adventurous expectancy which are conveyed to me by certain sights, ideas, occurrences, and images....&#x201d; But wait, you ask, what&#x2019;s all this about wonder and beauty and adventurous expectancy; isn&#x2019;t Lovecraft supposed to be a preeminent American horror writer? Well, yes, he is, and further along in his opening paragraph Lovecraft allows that his stories &#x201c;frequently emphasise the element of horror because&nbsp;...&nbsp;it is hard to create a convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or &#x2018;outsideness&#x2019; without laying stress on the emotion of fear.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Never during the final decade of his life&#x2014;a period coinciding more or less with the Cthulhu Mythos fiction&#x2014;did Lovecraft expressly consider himself to be a horror writer. He rather, as a cosmic fantasist, endeavored &#x201c;to weave gossamer ladders of escape from the galling tyranny of time, space, and natural law.&#x201d; Lovecraft further explains that &#x201c;In relation to the central wonder, the characters [in weird fiction] should shew the same overwhelming emotion [i.e. fear] which similar characters would shew toward such a wonder in real life&#x201d;; the horror element, in other words, is an ineluctable concomitant to his aesthetic theories, not an end in itself. Only decades after Lovecraft&#x2019;s death, when he was rediscovered by a shell-shocked postwar generation who had endured a cataclysmic global holocaust, followed by the omnipresent specters of Cold War paranoia and atomic annihilation&#x2014;only then was Lovecraft adjudged a &#x201c;horror writer&#x201d; by a generation of readers who had forgotten the meaning of cosmic wonder. Thus the reclusive Providence dreamer was invoked as orchestrator of the major uncertainties of our century, his Cthulhu deities the mythopoeic presentiment of everything from societal collapse to nuclear devastation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The reason the mature Lovecraft was never a writer of conventional horror fiction is that horror presupposes an actively malicious universe, both within and without the individual, whereas Lovecraft all his life was a scientific materialist for whom the concept of &#x201c;evil&#x201d; conveyed no absolute meaning. &#x201c;Only another collection of molecules&#x201d; was his characterization of an unfortunate encounter with a fellow human being, while in his relation to the cosmos-at-large, Lovecraft described himself as an &#x201c;indifferentist&#x201d;: &#x201c;The interplay of forces which govern climate, behaviour, biological growth and decay, and so on, is too purely universal, cosmic, and eternal a phenomenon to have any relationship to the immediate wishing-phenomena of one minute organic species on our transient and insignificant planet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Judeo-Christian theological tradition, on the other hand, posited a great cosmic drama of sin and redemption in which man, perched precariously between heaven and hell, was at the very center of Creation. But beginning in the fifteenth century, the Copernican revolution displaced the Earth as the center of the universe, and today our third-from-the-Sun planetary habitat is simply an inconsequential aqueous orb amid a whirl of other planets in a tiny outpost of the Milky Way galaxy, itself but one of billions of other galaxies in the visible universe; the divinely Edenic origin of our species likewise has given way to a creeping carbon-based creature struggling to emigrate from a primordial planetary pool. American physicist Steven Weinberg concluded his 1977 book The First Three Minutes with the chilling phrase &#x201c;the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.&#x201d; Four decades earlier, in a 1935 letter to one of his correspondents, Lovecraft had written presciently of &#x201c;the blind, indifferent cosmos, and the fortuitous, deterministically motivated automata who form a sort of momentary insect part on the surface of one of the least important of its temporary grains of dust.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If the scientifically minded Lovecraft had no belief in conventional notions of good versus evil, there remains to account for the extraordinary fascination he continues to exert over a worldwide readership. In a 1930 letter to James F. Morton, Lovecraft extols &#x201c;the quality of mystic adventurous expectancy itself&#x2014;the indefiniteness which permits me to foster the momentary illusion that almost any vista of wonder and beauty might open up, or almost any law of time or space or matter or energy be marvellously defeated or reversed or modified or transcended. That is the central keynote of my character and personality....&#x201d; Despite Lovecraft&#x2019;s obdurate lifelong atheism, his fervently expressed feelings of &#x201c;mystic adventurous expectancy&#x201d; are similar to what some would term a religious&#x2014;or at the very least, an unabashedly ecstatic&#x2014;experience; they are mystical and transcendent feelings, albeit engendered from dispassionate contemplation of a marvelous natural order.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few years after the Lovecraft letter cited above, Albert Einstein wrote of the cosmos that &#x201c;The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead.&nbsp;...&nbsp;A knowledge of something we cannot penetrate [i.e., the infinite universe], our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty&nbsp;...&nbsp;it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity.&#x201d; And here, in comparison, is Lovecraft&#x2019;s definition of the &#x201c;true function of fantasy&#x201d;: &#x201c;...&nbsp;to give the imagination a ground for limitless expansion, and to satisfy aesthetically the sincere and burning curiosity and sense of awe which a sensitive minority of mankind feel toward the alluring and provocative abysses of unplumbed space....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The &#x201c;rapturous ecstasy of the unknown,&#x201d; shall we call it? Lovecraft&#x2019;s implacable aesthetic revolt against the temporal and the corporeal cannot be easily articulated, but exists as an unmistakable philosophic underpinning to his entire adult fictional oeuvre, from the early Dunsanian stories to the mature Mythos masterworks. And this intensely obsessive tension between a finite mind grappling with infinite reality will serve to ensure Lovecraft&#x2019;s reputation among future generations. In his 1994 essay &#x201c;The Creatures Of Hyperspace,&#x201d; astronomer Alan Dressler argues that within a few hundred years, science is likely to reach its limit regarding a fundamental model of the universe. At that point, all continuing cosmological conundrums&#x2014;what happened before the Big Bang? what lies beyond the visible universe? and so forth&#x2014;will remain inaccessible to the human race, probably forever. And then the incomparable Lovecraft will be recalled: &#x201c;We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, H.P.L., that&#x2019;s what you told us all along, wasn&#x2019;t it?<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Asserting Native Resilience: Pacific Rim Indigenous Nations Face the Climate Crisis</h2><p>Indigenous nations are on the front line of the climate crisis.

The Van Veeteren series is published in thirty countries and has sold fifteen million copies worldwide.&nbsp;Nesser&nbsp;lives in Gotland, Sweden, with his wife.The bus zoomed past just as he emerged onto the sidewalk. <br> &nbsp;<br> He raised his hand automatically, in an attempt to persuade the driver to stop. Then he launched into a long series of curses as he watched the rear lights fade away up the hill toward the university. <br> &nbsp;<br> Shit! he thought. Why do they have to be dead on time tonight of all nights? Typical. Fucking typical. <br> &nbsp;<br> But when he checked the time he realized that in fact he was five minutes late&#x2014;so he had nobody to blame but himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Himself and Katrina. Mustn&#x2019;t forget her. Thinking of her made him feel better. He gritted his teeth and heaved up his backpack, opened up his hood and adjusted it, then set off walking. <br> &nbsp;<br> It would take him forty-five or fifty minutes, but he would be home by shortly after midnight no matter what. No big deal. His mother would be sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for him&#x2014;he could take that for granted, of course. Sitting there with that reproachful look she had perfected over the years, saying nothing but implying everything. But it was no big deal. Anybody could miss the last bus&#x2014;it could happen to the best families. <br> &nbsp;<br> When he came to the Keymer churchyard, he hesitated&#x2014;wondering whether or not to take the shortcut through it. He decided to skirt around it: it didn&#x2019;t look all that inviting in there among all the graves and the chapels, especially in view of the frosty mist creeping through the streets and alleys from the black canals. Intent on tucking the town into bed in its funeral shroud, it seemed. Once and for all. <br> &nbsp;<br> He shuddered and started walking more quickly. I could have stayed, he thought out of the blue. Could have phoned Mom and stayed with Katrina. She&#x2019;d have kicked up a fuss of course, but what could she have done about it? The last bus had already gone. A taxi would have been too expensive, and it was neither the time nor the weather for a young boy to be wandering around on his own. <br> &nbsp;<br> Nor for his mom to be urging him to do so. <br> &nbsp;<br> But these were mere thoughts. He pressed on notwithstanding. Through the municipal forest&#x2014;along the sparsely lit path for cyclists and pedestrians, half-running if truth be told, and emerg�ing onto the main road sooner than expected. He took a deep breath, and slowed down. Not far to go now, he thought. Just the long, boring walk along the main road&#x2014;nothing to look forward to, to be honest. There wasn&#x2019;t a lot of room for pedestrians and cyclists. Just a narrow strip between the ditch and the road along which to walk the tightrope, and the cars traveled at high speed. There was no speed limit, and no street lighting to speak of.<br> &nbsp;<br> Twenty minutes&#x2019; walk along a dark road in November. He&#x2019;d walked only a few hundred yards before a cold wind blew up and dispersed the mist, and it started pouring down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, shit! he thought. I could have been in bed with Katrina now. Naked, with Katrina pressed up against me, her warm body and caressing hands, her legs and her breasts that he had very nearly managed to touch . . . This rain must surely be a sign.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he kept on walking. Kept on walking through the rain and the wind and the darkness, thinking about the girl who would be his first.<br> &nbsp;<br> Would have been. <br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> He had parked slightly askew, was forced to back out, and just when he thought he had managed it to perfection he bumped into a dark-colored Opel, hitting it with his right rear bumper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, dammit! he thought. Why didn&#x2019;t I take a taxi? He opened the door carefully and peered back. Realized that it was only a glancing blow and nothing to worry about. A mere scratch. He closed the door. Besides, he told himself, the windows were all fogged up and he could hardly see out of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> He didn&#x2019;t bother to work out just how relevant that was, but instead drove rapidly out of the square and down to Zwille with no difficulty. There wasn&#x2019;t much traffic about; he reckoned he would be home in a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes at most, and <br> &nbsp;<br> while he sat waiting for the traffic lights in Alexanderlaan to turn green he started wondering if in fact there was any of that euca�lyptus bath gel left. He was slow to react when the lights changed, and stalled. Restarted in a hurry and raced the engine&#x2014;this fuck�ing dampness was causing havoc. . . . Then he cut the corner as he turned and hit the traffic island. <br> &nbsp;<br> Only with the front wheel, of course. Not much damage caused. . . . None at all, to be precise. Keep a straight face and press on, he told himself&#x2014;but it dawned on him that he was rather more drunk than he&#x2019;d thought. <br> &nbsp;<br> Damn and blast! he thought. I&#x2019;d better make sure I don&#x2019;t drive off the road. It wouldn&#x2019;t be a good idea to . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> He rolled down the side window a couple of inches and turned the air-conditioning up to maximum to get rid of the mist. Then drove commendably slowly for quite a while as he wormed his way through Bossingen and Deijkstraat, where there had not been a sighting of a traffic cop for the last thirty-five years; and when he emerged onto the main road it became obvious that the dan�ger of icy roads was nonexistent. It had started to pour down: he switched on the windshield wipers, and cursed for the fiftieth time that autumn for having forgotten to change the blades. <br> &nbsp;<br> Tomorrow, he thought. I&#x2019;ll drive to the service station first thing tomorrow morning. It&#x2019;s madness, sitting here driving without being able to see anything properly. <br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking back, he could never work out if it was what he saw or what he heard that came first. But in any case, what persisted most clearly in his memory was the soft thud and the slight jerk of the steering wheel. And in his dreams. The fact that what flashed past in a fraction of a second on the extreme right of his visual field was linked with the bump and the minimal vibration he felt in his hands was not something that registered on his consciousness. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not until he slammed on the brakes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not until afterward&#x2014;after the five or six seconds that must have passed before he drew to a halt and started running back along the soaking wet road.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he ran, he thought about his mother. About an occasion when he was ill&#x2014;it must have been just after he&#x2019;d started school&#x2014;and she&#x2019;d sat there pressing her cool hand onto his forehead while he threw up over and over and over again: yellowish-green bile into a red plastic bucket. It was so horribly painful, but that hand had been so cool and comforting&#x2014;and he wondered why on earth he should think about that just now. It was a memory of something that had happened more than thirty years ago, and he couldn&#x2019;t recall ever having remembered it before. His mother had been dead for more than ten years, so it was a mystery why she should crop up just now, and how he . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> He saw him when he had almost run past, and he knew he was dead even before he&#x2019;d come to a halt.<br> &nbsp;<br> A boy in a dark duffel coat. Lying in the ditch. Contorted at impossible angles, with his back pressed up against a concrete cul�vert and his face staring straight at him. As if he were trying to make some kind of contact. As if he wanted to tell him something. The boy&#x2019;s face was partly concealed by the hood, but the right-hand side&#x2014;the part that seemed to have been smashed against the concrete&#x2014;was exposed like . . . like an anatomical obscenity.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stood there, trying hard not to throw up. The same reflexes, the same old reflexes he&#x2019;d felt thirty years ago, definitely. Two cars passed by, one in each direction, but nobody seemed to have noticed anything amiss. He had started shaking, took two deep breaths, and jumped down into the ditch. Closed his eyes, then opened them again after a few seconds. Bent down and tried to feel a pulse, on the boy&#x2019;s wrist and on his bloodstained neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> No sign of a heartbeat. Oh hell, he thought, feeling panic creep�ing up on him. Fucking hell&#x2014;I must . . . I must . . . I must . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> He couldn&#x2019;t work out what he must do. Cautiously, he slid his arms under the boy&#x2019;s body, bent his knees and lifted him up. He felt a stabbing pain at the bottom of his back: the boy was rather heavier than he&#x2019;d expected. Perhaps the saturated clothes were adding to the problem. Insofar as he&#x2019;d expected anything at all. Why should he have? The backpack caused a bit of a problem. The backpack and the boy&#x2019;s head. Both of them insisted on leaning backward in a way that was quite unacceptable. He noted that the blood from the side of the boy&#x2019;s mouth was dripping straight down into his hood, and that he couldn&#x2019;t be more than fifteen or sixteen years old. A boy aged fifteen or sixteen . . . About the same as Greubner&#x2019;s son. You could tell by the sort of half-finished fea�tures of his face, despite the injuries. Quite a handsome boy, it seemed: no doubt he would develop into an attractive man. <br> &nbsp;<br> Would have. <br> &nbsp;<br> He stood down there in the ditch with the boy&#x2019;s body in his arms for quite some time, while thoughts whirled around in his head. It was only a yard or so up to the road, but it was steep and the rain had made it slippery and treacherous: he doubted whether he would be able to get a sufficient foothold. No cars passed by while he stood there, but he heard a moped approaching. Or possibly a low-powered motorbike, he thought. When it passed by he could hear that it was in fact a scooter, and he was momentarily blinded by its headlight. Presumably&#x2014;or so he thought later on with hindsight&#x2014;presumably it was that very second of blinding light that started him functioning again. <br> &nbsp;<br> Functioning, and thinking rational thoughts. <br> &nbsp;<br> He lay the body down again next to the culvert. Wondered if he should wipe the blood from his hands onto the wet grass but decided not to. Scrambled up onto the road, and hurried back to his car. <br> &nbsp;<br> He noted that he must have automatically switched off the engine but left the headlights on. Noted that the rain was pouring down like some sort of elemental force. Noted that he felt cold. <br> &nbsp;<br> He slid down behind the wheel and closed the door. Fastened his seat belt and drove off. He could see rather better now through the windows, as if the rain had cleaned the inside of the glass as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing has happened, he thought. Nothing at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt the first signs of a headache coming on, but then he remembered his mother&#x2019;s cool hand again&#x2014;and suddenly he was convinced that there was a drop left of that eucalyptus bubble bath gel after all.</p><h2>The Folk Art of Japanese Country Cooking: A Traditional Diet for Today&#39;s World</h2><p>Those who love Japanese food know there is more to it than sukiyaki, tempura, and sushi.

Aside from the scavengers steadily stripping the empty city to its bones, only a few thousand people remain, content to live quietly among the crumbling metropolis. Many, like the narrator, are there to try to escape the demons of their past. He spends his time observing and recording the decay around him, attempting to bury memories of what he has lost. <br><br> But it eventually becomes clear that things are unraveling elsewhere as well, as strangers, violent and desperate alike, begin to appear in the North End, spreading word of social and political deterioration in the South End and beyond. Faced with a growing disruption to his isolated life, the narrator discovers within himself a surprising need to resist losing the home he has created in this empty place. He and the rest of the citizens of the North End must choose whether to face outsiders as invaders or welcome them as neighbors. <br><br><i>The City Where We Once Lived</i> is a haunting novel of the near future that combines a prescient look at how climate change and industrial flight will shape our world with a deeply personal story of one man running from his past. In lean, spare prose, Eric Barnes brings into sharp focus questions of how we come to call a place home and what is our capacity for violence when that home becomes threatened.</p><p><b>Eric Barnes</b> is the author of two previous novels, <i>Shimmer</i> and <i>Something Pretty, Something Beautiful</i>.

She'd been raised as a gun-fearing environmentalist and an animal lover, and though a meat-eater, she'd always abided by the principle that harming animals is wrong. But Raff McCaulou's perspective shifted when she began spending weekends fly-fishing and weekdays interviewing hunters for her articles, realizing that many of them were more thoughtful about animals and the environment than she was. <br><br>So she embarked upon the project of learning to hunt from square one. From attending a Hunter Safety course designed for children to field dressing an elk and serving it for dinner, she explores the sport of hunting and all it entails, and tackles the big questions surrounding one of the most misunderstood American practices and pastimes. Not just a personal memoir, this book also explores the role of the hunter in the twenty-first century, the tension (at times artificial) between hunters and environmentalists, and new models of sustainable and ethical food procurement.</p><p>Lily Raff McCaulou lives in Bend, Oregon, where she writes a twice weekly column for the Bend <em>Bulletin.</em> In 2010, she completed a prestigious Knight-Wallace journalism fellowship at the University of Michigan, where she researched this book."Her writing is evocative and inspiring, and it will encourage all manner of nature lovers to forge a deeper connection to their surroundings. . . .

The book presents a solid introduction to the history, theology, and significance of Luther&#39;s catechisms. Arand explores critical issues on the church&#39;s catechetical tradition, the purpose and setting of Luther&#39;s Small and Large Catechism, the heart of the Catechism&#39;s content, and the ways the Catechism shapes God&#39;s people in faith and life.</p><p></p><h2>Mission America: Straight Talk About Military Transition</h2><p>Ever since the days of Homer, warriors have faced an epic battle for which many were ill-prepared - coming home after a life of military service.

These accounts,&nbsp;selected to help teenagers relate to the horrific experiences of slaves their own age living&nbsp;in the not-so-distant past, include&nbsp;stories of young slaves&nbsp;torn from their mothers and families, suffering from starvation, and being whipped and tortured. But these are not all tales of deprivation and violence; teenagers will&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;of slaves challenging authority, playing games, telling jokes,&nbsp;and falling in love. These stories cover the range of the slave experience, from the passage in slave ships across the Atlantic&#x2014;and daily life as a slave both on large plantations and in small-city dwellings&#x2014;to escaping slavery&nbsp;and fighting in the Civil War. The writings of Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, Elizabeth Keckley, and other lesser-known slaves are included.<br></p><p><b>Yuval Taylor </b>is a<b>&nbsp;</b>senior editor&nbsp;at Lawrence Hill Books, where he&nbsp;pioneered the Library of Black America series.

The 10 excerpts are arranged chronologically by original publication date and span the years between 1745 and the 1860s. Each narrative is preceded by brief biographical notes about its author and concludes with an account of the remainder of the person's life. These articulate, heartbreaking stories show slavery's effect on its youngest victims, children subjected to extraordinary toil and punishment from their earliest years. The circumstances and personalities of the authors differed significantly. One was captured in Africa and suffered the horrors of transport in a slave ship. Some toiled on large plantations, others on small farms or in city houses. Adolescent girls suffered from the attentions of predatory masters and the vengeance of jealous mistresses. Surviving brutality, fear, and deprivation, the children prevailed through courage, resolution, and wisdom. The risks taken to learn to read or to visit a beloved relative sold to a new master were incredible. Ten woodcut illustrations are included.<i>-Kathy Tewell, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he finds a flyer asking if he'd like to keep Holiday, he encounters a bigger and better Holiday than the one his family has always visited; he also learns that entering it requires the Founder's authorization. Thus begins Dylan's quest to meet the one of whom people keep saying: "You can't find the Founder; he finds you./He's not just the Founder, he's the Finder too."</p><p>As Dylan reads of Holiday's origins, he experiences a number of adventures and meets characters who represent the sights and sounds he always finds in Holiday-characters who explain how each of these familiarities points to the Founder's previous rescue of the city's inhabitants. And the more Dylan learns, the more he longs to personally know the one who holds the key to entering the "real Holiday."</p><p>Writing for elementary-age children and older, author, teacher, and grandmother Starr Meade offers a book that families can read together, discovering along with Dylan how God brings a person to faith. <em>Keeping Holiday</em> is also a charming, insightful way to help children grasp the meaning of the Incarnation.</p></p><p><p><strong>Starr Meade</strong> served as the director of children&#x2019;s ministries for ten years at her local church and taught Latin and Bible for eight years at a Christian school.

Call them what you like: Sex and Death, Love and Destruction, Temptation and Terror. While many may strive to reach the extremes, few authors manage to find the beauty that rests in the liminal space between these polar forces, the shuddering ecstasy encased within the shock. And then there&#39;s Livia Llewellyn, an author praised for her dark, stirring, evocative prose and disturbing, personal narratives. Lush, layered, multifaceted, and elegant, the thirteen tales comprising Furnace showcase why Livia Llewellyn has been lauded by scholars and fans of weird fiction alike, and why she has been nominated multiple times for the Shirley Jackson Award and included in year&#39;s best anthologies. These are exquisite stories, of beauty and cruelty, of pleasure and pain, of hunger, and of sharp teeth sinking into tender flesh.</p><p>Livia Llewellyn is an award-nominated writer of horror, darkfantasy and erotica, whose fiction has appeared in ChiZine, Subterranean<i>, </i>Apex Magazine, Postscripts, NightmareMagazine, as well as numerousanthologies<i>.</i> <i>Engines of Desire: Tales of Love &amp;Other Horrors</i> received a 2011 Shirley Jackson Award nomination for BestCollection, "Omphalos received a 2011 SJA for Best Novelette, and "Furnace" receiveda 2013 SJA nomination for Best Short Fiction. You can find her online atliviallewellyn.com.Llewellyn&#39;s second short story collection (after Engines of Desire) showcases her assured writing with compelling and involving tales of horror, often concerning the particular horrors of being female. Llewellyn skillfully incorporates Lovecraft, science fantasy, and classic Greek and Celtic mythology into fresh new narratives. &#34;In the Court of King Cupressaceae, 1982,&#34; original to the collection, displays her talent for folding the deeply weird into contemporary culture as college student Severin tests the boundaries of her connection to the world of the fey. Other standouts are &#34;It Feels Better Biting Down,&#34; a stellar exploration of the relationship shared by uncanny twins that&#39;s full of lush language and an unnerving use of pronouns, and &#34;The Last, Clean, Bright Summer,&#34; chronicling unhappy teens unwillingly accompanying their family to the seaside. Her descriptives can sometimes be repetitive when the stories are read close together, but Llewellyn&#39;s lush vocabulary and sense of place combine with her ability to imbue her characters with distinctive voices and make her a notable contributor to the field.

For every Sherlock Holmes or Sam Spade in noble pursuit, there's a Count Dracula, a Lester Leith, or a Jimmy Valentine. These are the rogues and villains who haunt our imaginations--and who often have more in common with their heroic counterparts than we might expect. Now, for the first time ever, Otto Penzler gathers the iconic traitors, thieves, con men, sociopaths, and killers who have crept through the mystery canon over the past 150 years, captivating and horrifying readers in equal measure. The 72 handpicked stories in this collection introduce us to the most depraved of psyches, from iconic antiheroes like Maurice Leblanc's Ars�ne Lupin and Sax Rohmer's Dr. Fu Manchu to contemporary delinquents like Lawrence Block's Ehrengraf and Donald Westlake's Dortmunder, and include unforgettable tales by Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Washington Irving, Jack London, H.G.

He lives in New York City, where he is the proprietor of the Mysterious Bookshop.INTRODUCTION<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Mystery fiction encompasses a broad spectrum of sub-genres, although it is common for casual aficionados to focus on the detective story as the only &#x201c;true&#x201d; mystery. As I have often defined it, and, quite naturally, I regard it as a good and fair definition, a mystery is any work of prose fiction in which a crime or the threat of a crime is central to the theme or plot. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a football field, the pure detective story may go from the end zone to the twenty-five yard line. The crime story, in which the central figure is a criminal of some kind, whether rogue or villain (and I&#x2019;ll get to that shortly), may move the ball another twenty yards. The novel of suspense, which includes women or children in jeopardy, the everyday gone wrong, as well as tales of psychological unease and irrational behavior, whether of sociopathy or fear, will produce a long gain well past midfield, and espionage/international intrigue, will cross the goal-line. The killing of a large number of people is, of course, part of the same horrific game as the killing of an individual.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are numerous sub-sub genres (historical mysteries, police procedurals, comedies, etc.) but they fall within the prime sub-genres, many of which also overlap: all forms may (one might say <i>should</i>) create suspense, spies may work as detectives to catch moles, psychopaths tend to be criminals, and their actions may well create suspense and a detective is probably hunting them, so the lines blur.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preponderance of anthologies published in the nearly century-and-a-quarter since the first legitimate mystery anthology, the anonymously edited <i>The Long Arm and Other Detective Tales </i>was released in 1895, have featured detectives as the central characters. This collection has reversed that common practice to focus on criminals. The title, <i>The Big Book of Rogues and Villains</i>, very specifically divides the protagonists into two groups, mostly quite different from each other, although those lines also blur from time to time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roguery must be distinguished from villainy. The latter is the creature of evil and malice, if not of outright pathology. It is bad behavior carried to an unpleasant extreme&#x2014;generally murder. The former tends not to be vicious, prefers no serious physical injury to others, and defines itself as rascality soaked in humor or explained as the result of an unfortunate social environment. Again, the lines may blur from time to time, as a rogue may cause severe hardship or fear in others, while the villain may have a tender heart for a dog or a child, even if he has murdered someone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we may normally be easily able to perceive the distinction between roguery and villainy, the contrast may hinge less upon the venality or atrocity of the deed perpetrated than upon the character&#x2019;s and the author&#x2019;s point of view.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical crime of the rogue is theft, whether by burglary, swindling, forgery, blackmail, or other physically non-violent transgressions. If his escapades lead to serious physical violence, that action will generally end his career as a rascal and places him into the category of villain. Most rogues prefer to win by guile or dexterity that which others have earned by labor or inherited. He may create a phony business with worthless stock, forge a will or a check, cheat at cards, scheme for marriage to an heiress, crack a safe in the dark of night, or replace a genuine Old Master with a fake. History and literature have shown there is no end to the nefarious schemes of which the amoral mind is incapable of devising.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical crime of the villain is murder, for which there is seldom an acceptable excuse. Although one of the protagonists in this book excuses his action by saying, &#x201c;He needed killing,&#x201d; not everyone would agree. Still, there are myriad reasons that not only excuse killing but applaud it. Not all killing, it may be said, is murder. Self-defense is the easiest to justify, and there are two sides vehemently opposed to other examples of taking a human life. The most frequently posited is: &#x201c;Given the chance to go back in time, would you kill (pick your <i>real</i> villain&#x2014;Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a long list) given the opportunity?&#x201d; And would it make you a villain if you did?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m in danger of asking next how many angels could dance around the head of a pin, while this large gathering of fictional rogues and villains is designed merely to give pleasure. It&#x2019;s a giant shelf-filler of what was once known as escapist fiction before the term fell into disfavor. Is any fiction not escapist?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thoughtfully but impossibly divided into sections, though as I compiled the Table of Contents I realized that there are many stories that easily could fall into more than one category, so please don&#x2019;t take the divisions too seriously. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heyday of the gentleman thief was the end of the Victorian era and the Edwardian era, and many of the stories have a similarity that&#x2019;s hard to avoid with a book of this kind. The crooks often have good standing in the community and they dress well. It&#x2019;s a game to them, even if a dangerous one, and they carry off their roles with insouciance and verve. Many of them are brilliant and have nerves of steel. They are seemingly infallible, rarely getting caught but, if they do, they always find a way out through their wit, a bogus alibi, or a flummoxed witness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a grammatical aside, I&#x2019;ve been using the pronoun &#x201c;he&#x201d; because &#x201c;they&#x201d; is just flat-out wrong and &#x201c;he or she&#x201d; is cumbersome, so no offense to anybody. But women have their roles here, too, and you will undoubtedly find them as charming as their &#x201c;gangs&#x201d; do. You will find Fidelity Dove and Four Square Jane very similar, but there was never a thought of omitting either. Almost all the female rogues (and villains) are young and beautiful&#x2014;all the better to fool their victims as well as the police.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other similarities of style and performance occur in the stories about the morally-challenged lawyers Randolph Mason and Ehrengraf, the adventures of hit men Quarry and Keller, the modus operandi of con men Wallingford and Colonel Clay, the conscienceless actions of &#x201c;Yellow Peril&#x201d; monsters Quong Lung and Fu Manchu, and the rogues of Erle Stanley Gardner. Then again, there are not many differences between the methods of such iconic detectives as Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, and Lew Archer. What matters is how creatively and beautifully the authors tell the stories.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The genre has its rules and restrictions, just as symphonies and sonnets have theirs. One raspberry has its similarities to another, but the point is not to seek a major variation, merely to enjoy it. I hope you enjoy these stories and their variations.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And remember: Crime may pay in fiction but it&#x2019;s not a good choice in real life.

"All Ellie wanted to do was help her friend." Ellie shows readers true acts of compassion and problem-solving. The problem is clear: Lucy needs sleep. Ellie calmly stands by her friend's side as each sleep aid is explored without success. When Ellie hears Betty Bluebird sing a lullaby to her babies, she has a new idea. She enlists the aid of Gerard, the wise gorilla, and organizes the animals into musical sections, just like an orchestra. She helps each animal find his or her tune. With patience and practice, Ellie changes the nightly noise in the zoo into a beautiful song that helps Lucy finally go to sleep. Wu's expressive watercolor illustrations are imbued with kindness and comfort even through the inharmonious screaming and squinting of the noisy animals.

Is it any wonder, then, that all manner of current social ills are blamed on the disintegration of family life? Children need to see that the spiritual life is significant to their parents at home as well as at church. If your home life differs from the image you present at church, your kids will see faith as contrived and irrelevant. In this revised and expanded edition, Thompson suggests models, rituals and celebrations that will inspire your children to grow spiritually and will help center your family on God. Family the Forming Center will help you, as parents, develop close family relationships filled with God&#39;s love, trust and values.&#34;</p><p>In a time when &#39;family&#39; is being redefined daily, Thompson provides core theology behind the understanding of family--family in all its diversity.

Like Sebald&#x2019;s or Cusk&#x2019;s, her haunted writing patrols its own omissions . . . The figure of the shipwreck looms large for Aridjis. It becomes a useful lens through which to see this book, which is self-contained, inscrutable, and weirdly captivating, like a salvaged object that wants to return to the sea." </b>&#x2015;Katy Waldman, <i>The New Yorker</i> <br><br> One autumn afternoon in Mexico City, seventeen-year-old Luisa does not return home from school. Instead, she boards a bus to the Pacific coast with Tom�s, a boy she barely knows. He seems to represent everything her life is lacking&#x2015;recklessness, impulse, independence. Tom�s may also help Luisa fulfill an unusual obsession: she wants to track down a traveling troupe of Ukrainian dwarfs. According to newspaper reports, the dwarfs recently escaped a Soviet circus touring Mexico. The imagined fates of these performers fill Luisa&#x2019;s surreal dreams as she settles in a beach community in Oaxaca. Surrounded by hippies, nudists, beachcombers, and eccentric storytellers, Luisa searches for someone, anyone, who will &#x201c;promise, no matter what, to remain a mystery.&#x201d; It is a quest more easily envisioned than accomplished. As she wanders the shoreline and visits the local bar, Luisa begins to disappear dangerously into the lives of strangers on Zipolite, the &#x201c;Beach of the Dead.&#x201d;<br><br> Meanwhile, her father has set out to find his missing daughter. A mesmeric portrait of transgression and disenchantment unfolds. <i>Sea Monsters</i> is a brilliantly playful and supple novel about the moments and mysteries that shape us.</p><p>Chloe Aridjis is a Mexican-American writer who was born in New York and grew up in the Netherlands and Mexico. After completing her Ph.D. at the University of Oxford in nineteenth-century French poetry and magic shows, she lived for nearly six years in Berlin.

She lives in London.<i>Imprisoned on this island</i>, I would say, <i>Imprisoned on this island.</i> And yet I was no prisoner and this was no island.<br> <br>During the day I&#x2019;d roam the shore, aimlessly, purposefully, and in search of digressions. The dogs. A hut. Boulders. Nude tourists. Scantily clad ones. Palm trees. Palapas. Sand sifting umber and adrenaline. The waves&#x2019; upward grasp. A boat in the distance, its throat flashing in the sun. The ancient Greeks created stories out of a simple juxtaposition of natural features, my father once told me, investing rocks and caves with meaning, but there in Zipolite I did not expect any myths to be born.<br> <br>Zipolite. People said the name meant Beach of the Dead, though the reason for this was debated&#x2015;was it because of the number of visitors who met their end in the treacherous currents, or because the native Zapotecs would bring their dead from afar to bury in its sands? Beach of the Dead: it had an ancient ring, ancestral, commanding both dread and respect, and after hearing about the unfortunate souls who each year got caught in the riptide I decided I would never go in beyond where I could stand. Others said Zipolite meant Lugar de Caracoles, place of seashells, an attractive thought since spirals are such neat arrangements of space and time, and what are beaches if not a conversation between the elements, a constant movement inward and outward? Yet my favorite explanation, which only one person put forward, was that Zipolite was a corruption of the word <i>zopilote</i>, and that every night a black vulture would envelope the beach in its dark wings and feed on whatever the waves tossed up. It&#x2019;s easier to reconcile yourself with sunny places if you can imagine their nocturnal counterpart.<br> <br>Once dusk had fallen I would head to the bar and spend hours under its thatched universe, a large palapa on the shores of the Pacific decked with stools, tables, and miniature palm trees. It was where all boats came to dock and refuel, syrup added to cocktails for maximum sweetness, and I&#x2019;d imagine that everything was as artificial as the electric blue drink: that the miniature palm trees grew fake after dusk, the chlorophyll struggling and the life force gone from the green, that the wooden stools had turned to laminate. Sometimes the hanging lamps would be dimmed and the music amplified, a cue for the drunks and half drunks to clamber onto the tables and start dancing. The shoreline ran through every face, destroying some, enhancing others, and at moments when I&#x2019;d had enough reminders of humanity I would look around for the dogs who like everyone else at the beach came and went according to mood. A curious snout or a pair of gleaming eyes would appear on the fringes of the palapa, take in the scene, and then, most often, finding nothing of interest, retire once more into darkness.<br> <br>Before long, it became apparent that the bar in Zipolite was a meeting place for fabulists, and everyone seemed to concoct a tale as the night wore on. One girl, a painter with cartoon lips and squinty eyes, said her boyfriend had suffered a heart attack on his yacht and been forced to drop her off at the nearest port since his wife was about to be helicoptered in with a doctor. In more collected tones, a tall German explained to everyone that he was a representative of the German Society for Protection Against Superstition, or Deutsche Gesellschaft Schutz vor Aberglauben&#x2015;he wrote the name in tiny German script on a sheet of rolling paper for us to read&#x2015;and had been sent to Mexico after a stint in Italy. An actress from Zacatecas no one had heard of insisted she was so famous that a theater, a planet, and a crater on Venus had been named after her.<br> <br>And you, someone would ask, noticing how intently I listened, What brought you here?<br> <br>I had run away, I told them, I&#x2019;d run away from home.<br> <br>Are your parents evil?<br> <br>No, not at all. . . . I was in Zipolite with a boy. I&#x2019;d run away, mainly, because of a boy.<br> <br>And where was this boy?<br> <br>Good question.<br> <br>And <i>who</i> was this boy?<br> <br>Another good question.<br> <br>But that, too, was only half the truth. I had also come here because of the dwarves. However fantastical it now seemed, I was here with Tom�s, a boy I hardly knew, in search of a troupe of Ukrainian dwarves. And if I stopped to think about it for more than a few instants, the situation was almost entirely my fault. It was therefore not surprising that calming thoughts were hard to come by. No calm, but I did feel profoundly numb, as if stuck halfway through a dream, a dream I didn&#x2019;t seem able to exit.<br></p><h2>Mayflower Lives: Pilgrims in a New World and the Early American Experience</h2><p><p><strong>A fresh and revealing history of one of the most seminal events in American history as seen through fourteen diverse and dynamic figures.</strong></p> Leading into the 400th anniversary of the voyage of the <em>Mayflower</em>, Martyn Whittock examines the lives of the &#x201c;saints&#x201d; (members of the Separatist puritan congregations) and &#x201c;strangers&#x201d; (economic migrants) on the original ship.

The sleepless body hammering a nail nails itself, hanging crucified.--from "Catullus: Excrucior" In Frank Bidart's collection of poems, the encounter with desire is the encounter with destiny. The first half contains some of Bidart's most luminous and intimate work-poems about the art of writing, Eros, and the desolations and mirror of history (in a spectacular narrative based on Tacitus). The second half of the book exts the overt lyricism of the opening section into even more ambitious territory-"The Second Hour of the Night" may be Bidart's most profound and complex meditation on the illusion of will, his most seductive dramatic poem to date.</p><p><i>Desire</i> is a 1997 National Book Award Finalist for Poetry.</p></p><p><i>Desire</i>, Frank Bidart's first book since <i>In the Western Night: Collected Poems 1965-1990</i>, is in two parts. Part I is a collection of short poems; Part II consists of a single poem, "The Second Hour of the Night," a sequel to "The First Hour of the Night" that ends <i>In the Western Night</i>. Bidart, a poet who makes a large arc between the universal and the idiosyncratic, has learned that the transformations themselves, rendered without comment, have the capacity to chill your blood. <p> The source for "The Second Hour of the Night" is Ovid's story of Myrrha and her father Cinyras, one of the least-known but most suggestive tales--a reversal of the Oedipus myth. Bidart's tormented dramatization of Ovid's version reads like an investigation into the deepest layers of the story. While both poets turn the doomed heroine into a plant, Bidart looks into causes and motivation in a way that Ovid does not. </p><p> The short poems in the first section of <i>Desire</i> are also very strong. The poet, torn apart by the death of his lover, gives you a sense of the distance he has traveled over the past 15 years when he retranslates the two-line poem "Catullus: Excrucior," which he brilliantly adapted in <i>The Sacrifice</i>. </p><p> Version in <i>The Sacrifice</i>: </p><blockquote> I hate <i>and</i> love. Ignorant fish, who even<br> wants the fly while writhing. </blockquote> Version in <i>Desire</i>: <blockquote> <i>I hate and--love</i>. The sleepless body hammering a nail nails<br> itself, hanging crucified. </blockquote> Bidart's acute perception of complicity allows him to do away with the idea of the victim. This is a formidable achievement, and his work is worthy of the scrutiny it demands.<p><b>Frank Bidart's</b> poems are collected in<i> In the Western Night: Collected Poems 1965-90 </i>(FSG, 1990). In 1998 he won the Bobbitt Prize and received a Lannan Literary Fellowship. He teaches at Wellesley College.</p></p><h2>Show Them a Good Time</h2><p><p><b> A blisteringly original and wickedly funny collection of stories about the strange worlds that women inhabit and the parts that they must play.</b></p><p>A sense of otherworldly menace is at work in the fiction of Nicole Flattery, but the threats are all too familiar. SHOW THEM A GOOD TIME tells the stories of women slotted away into restrictive roles: the celebrity's girlfriend, the widower's second wife, the lecherous professor's student, the corporate employee. And yet, the genius of Flattery's characters is to blithely demolish the boundaries of these limited and limiting social types with immense complexity and caustic intelligence. Nicole Flattery's women are too ferociously mordant, too painfully funny to remain in their places.</p><p>In this fiercely original and blazingly brilliant debut, Flattery likewise deconstructs the conventions of genre to serve up strange realities: In <i>Not the End Yet</i>, Flattery probes the hilarious and wrenching ambivalence of Internet dating as the apocalypse nears; in <i>Sweet Talk</i>, the mysterious disappearance of a number of local women sets the scene for a young girl to confront the dangerous uncertainties of her own sexuality; in this collection's center piece, <i>Abortion, A Love Story</i>, two college students in a dystopian campus reconfigure the perilous stories of their bodies in a fraught academic culture to offer a subversive, alarming, and wickedly funny play that takes over their own offstage lives. And yet, however surreal or richly imagined the setting, Flattery always shows us these strange worlds from startlingly unexpected angles, through an unforgettable cast of brutally honest, darkly hilarious women and girls. </p><p>Like the stories of Mary Gaitskill, Miranda July, Lorrie Moore, Joy Williams, and Ottessa Moshfegh, SHOW THEM A GOOD TIME is the work of a profoundly resonant and revelatory literary voice &#x2013; at once spiky, humane, achingly hilarious-- that is sure to echo through the literary culture for decades to come.</p></p><p><b>Nicole Flattery</b>'s work has been published in <i>The Stinging Fly, The White Review, The Dublin Review</i>, BBC Radio 4, <i>The Irish Times </i>and<i> Winter Papers.</i> She has also contributed a story to Faber's 2019 Anthology of New Irish Writing. A graduate of the master's program in Creative Writing at Trinity College, Dublin, she lives in Galway.<p>&#x201c;<i>Show Them a Good Time </i>is a master class in the short story-bold, irreverent and agonizingly funny.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sally Rooney, Author of NORMAL PEOPLE and CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS</i></p><p>&#x201c;Startling, daring, and dazzlingly dark.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Colin Barrett, author of YOUNG SKINS</i></p><p>&#x201c;Demands repeated reading. These stories are very funny, and very sad, usually at the same time. Which, as Flattery shows us brilliantly, is the best time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jon McGregor author of RESERVOIR 13</i></p><p>&#x201c;Smart as a whip, unusual, and very, very funny, Flattery's distinctive prose is a real treat.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Claire-Louise Bennett, author of POND</i></p><p>&#x201c;Flattery's judgments crackle with cruel, clear sight . . . The book's epigraph comes from Lorrie Moore, who is an obvious influence on the high-wire style, those seductive insights armored with glittering wit against the pain they describe. Flattery writes with empathy, freedom and virtuosic technique: this debut announces the arrival of a brilliant talent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Luke Brown, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Highly addictive...Flattery's off-kilter voice blends chatty candour and hard-to-interpret allegory (think Diane Williams or Lorrie Moore), with the deadpan drollery and casually disturbing revelations heightened by her fondness for cutting any obvious connective tissue between sentences.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Irish women writers are on fire, and Nicole Flattery is yet a further brilliant example ... Ten smart stories about dating, relationships and the absurdities of modern life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elle.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;At its best, which is often, Flattery's prose has a thrilling relentlessness and rhythmical snap to it; it pummels and excites.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Guardian</i></p></p><h2>Queer City: Gay London from the Romans to the Present Day</h2><p>In <i>Queer City,</i> the acclaimed Peter Ackroyd looks at London in a whole new way&#x2013;through the complete history and experiences of its gay and lesbian population. In Roman <i>Londinium</i>, the city was dotted with <i>lupanaria</i> (&#x201c;wolf dens&#x201d; or public pleasure houses), <i>fornices</i> (brothels), and <i>thermiae</i> (hot baths). Then came the Emperor Constantine, with his bishops, monks, and missionaries. And so began an endless loop of alternating permissiveness and censure. Ackroyd takes us right into the hidden history of the city; from the notorious Normans to the frenzy of executions for sodomy in the early nineteenth century. He journeys through the coffee bars of sixties Soho to Gay Liberation, disco music, and the horror of AIDS. Ackroyd reveals the hidden story of London, with its diversity, thrills, and energy, as well as its terrors, dangers, and risks, and in doing so, explains the origins of all English-speaking gay culture.</p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning historian, biographer, novelist, poet, and broadcaster. He is the author of the acclaimed nonfiction <i>bestsellers London: The Biography, Thames,</i> and <i>London Under</i>; biographies of figures including Charles Dickens, William Blake, and Alfred Hitchcock; and a multi-volume history of England. He has won the Whitbread Biography Award, the <i>Guardian</i> Fiction Prize, and the Somerset Maugham Award.

Signaled by the triumph of abstraction and the ascendancy of painters such as Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline, this revolution generated an exuberant and contentious body of writing without parallel in our cultural history. In the words of editor Jed Perl, &#x201c;there has never been a period when the visual arts have been written about with more mongrel energy&#x2014;with more unexpected mixtures of reportage, rhapsody, analysis, advocacy, editorializing, and philosophy.&#x201d; Perl has gathered the best of this writing together for the first time, interwoven with fascinating headnotes that establish the historical background, the outsized personalities of the artists and critics, and the nature of the aesthetic battles that defined the era. Here are statements by the most significant artists, and major critical essays by Clement Greenberg, Susan Sontag, Hilton Kramer, and other influential figures. Here too is an electrifying array of responses by poets and novelists, reflecting the free interplay between different art forms: John Ashbery on Andy Warhol, James Agee on Helen Levitt, James Baldwin on Beauford Delaney, Truman Capote on Richard Avedon, Tennessee Williams on Hans Hofmann, Jack Kerouac on Robert Frank. The atmosphere of the time comes to vivid life in memoirs, diaries, and journalism by Peggy Guggenheim, Dwight Macdonald, Calvin Tomkins, and others. Lavishly illustrated with scores of black-and-white images and a 32-page color insert, this is a book that every art lover will treasure.</p><p><b>JED PERL</b> is the art critic for <i>The New Republic</i>. A former contributing editor at <i>Vogue</i>, he has written on contemporary art for a variety of publications, including <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> and <i>Elle</i>, and is the author of <i>New Art City: Manhattan at Mid-Century</i> (2005), <i>Eyewitness: Reports from an Art World in Crisis</i> (2000), <i>Gallery Going: Four Seasons in the Art World</i> (1991), and <i>Paris Without End: On French Art Since World War I</i> (1988). He teaches art history at the New School."It's a plump, unbuttoned and convivial book, streaked like bacon with gossip and cogitation. . . . [Mr. Perl] is interested in the era's tumult, its howls and murmurs, its wolf whistles and rebel yells. He has raided memoirs, magazines and interviews for material; he's also rummaged through forgotten pamphlets and yellowed correspondence. This is a party that spills out onto the lawn." &#x2014; <b><b>Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i></b></b><br><br>"Every student ought to have a copy in the studio or carrel. . . .

What emerges is surely one of the defining records of our artistic age." &#x2014; <b><b>John Ashbery</b></b><br><br>"Jed Perl has compiled an invigorating panorama of art writing from a crucial quarter century, adding vital context with his incisive commentaries. As today's art writers suffer diminishing visibility, the pleasures to be had exploring this collection comes as a salutary shock. An unexpectedly compulsive read." &#x2014; <b><b>Elizabeth C.

Thrust into an unfamiliar world by a stranger with a dangerous agenda, Etta is certain of only one thing: she has traveled not just miles, but years from home. And she's inherited a legacy she knows nothing about from a family whose existence she's never heard of. Until now.<br><br>Nicholas Carter is content with his life at sea, free from the Ironwoods-a powerful family in the Colonies-and the servitude he's known at their hands. But with the arrival of an unusual passenger on his ship comes the insistent pull of the past that he can't escape and the family that won't let him go so easily. Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, his passenger, can find. In order to protect her, Nick must ensure she brings it back to them-whether she wants to or not. <br>Together, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveler who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoods' grasp. But as they get closer to the truth of their search, and the deadly game the Ironwoods are playing, treacherous forces threaten to separate Etta not only from Nicholas but from her path home forever.</p><p>Alexandra Bracken is the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Passenger series and The Darkest Minds series.

Visit her online at www.alexandrabracken.com and on Twitter @alexbracken.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;This series opener doesn't let up its high-octane pace until the final page. In a matter of moments, Etta, a talented teenage violinist in New York City, goes from making her concert soloist debut to finding herself prisoner aboard a ship in the distant past. It turns out she is descended from one of a dwindling number of time-traveling families who manipulate history in an ongoing fight for power and influence. The captain of the ship, Nicholas Carter, was hired to retrieve Etta and bring her to the head of the most powerful family. Together they must travel across the globe and through different time periods in search of the long missing astrolabe. There are plenty of twists and turns and excitement as they travel&#x2014;though at almost 500 pages, the story has periods where it drags, and complex plot machinations and world-building threaten to overwhelm the narrative. Luckily, the romance crackling between Nicholas and Etta will keep fans intrigued. VERDICT This strong new series will appeal to readers looking for a time-traveling adventure with plenty of drama and romance.&#x2014;Eliza Langhans, Hatfield Public Library, MA</p><h2>American Women Afield: Writings by Pioneering Women Naturalists (Volume 20) (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)</h2><p>Armed with hand lenses and opera glasses, traveling on foot, by buggy, or model T, they explored thousands of miles of deserts, forests, beaches, and jungles. They were pioneering women naturalists who observed, studied, and experimented, then returned to write up their findings. What resulted were exquisitely written and scientifically accurate accounts of their explorations into natural science--a field long dominated by men. <br><br>Marcia Myers Bonta has collected the most charming and sensitive writings of twenty-five women naturalists of the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries and supplemented them with well-researched biographical profiles. From Susan Fenimore Cooper's early warnings about the profligate use of natural resources to Mary Treat's tenacious defense of her scientific discoveries, from Alice Eastwood's defiance of convention and Caroline Dormon's, Lucy Braun's, and Rachel Carson's impassioned pleas to save the earth, American Women Afield catalogs the determination and devotion of these early scientists and acknowledges their invaluable contributions to ornithology, entomology, botany, agrostology, and ecology.<br><br>Each excerpt in this book reveals the important role these women played not only as writers but as popularizers of nature study at a time when very little literature on this subject was available to the general public. Whether scientist or generalist, the reader will discover insights into their methods of field work as they tame wasps, camp out in jungles, climb unnamed mountaintops, or sit patiently in the woods for hours.<br><br>Written as a companion book to Bonta's earlier published Women in the Field: America's Pioneering Women Naturalists, American Women Afield adds an additional dimension to female scientific history by presenting the authors' own words. Luckily for the reader, Bonta has scoured libraries, museums, and private collections to uncover letters, out-of-print journal articles, field notes, and selected book chapters from the recesses of academia. Each selection is unique in style, tone, and subject and clearly shows not only the authors' love of nature but their desire to communicate that love to others.<br><br>American Women Afield is a charming, informative, and revealing account of pioneering women--mentors whose lives have been forgotten for far too long.</p><p>Marcia Myers Bonta is the author of five other books on nature and natural history, including Women in the Field published by Texas A&amp;M University Press. She has published over 200 nature-oriented articles in such state and national magazines as Birder's World, Living Bird, Bird Watcher's Digest, and American Horticulturist. She also writes a column on Pennsylvania natural areas for Pennsylvania Wildlife and a monthly column for Pennsylvania Game News.The 20th in Texas A&amp;M's Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environmental Series and a companion to Bonta's Women in the Field, this book highlights the works of 25 women naturalists whose writing is as noteworthy for its scientific insight as for its feminine perspective. Over a century before such writers as Rachel Carson would put pen to paper and influence a new generation of women naturalists, 19th-century writers Susan Fenimore Cooper, Mary Treat and Althea Sherman wrote as if to prove once and for all that Thoreau and his male cohorts were not alone in their desire to study and preserve the natural resources disappearing around them. Cooper's Rural Hours and Treat's Home Studies in Nature, both excerpted here, preserve in beautifully written passages glimpses of many plants and birds long since extinct. In "Ecology and World War I," an excerpt from her Adventures in Ecology, Edith Clements recounts her career as a naturalist. That Clements most often worked alongside and in the shadow of her husband, acclaimed plant ecologist Frederic Clements, takes nothing from her prose. Bonta includes biographical entries and bibliographies for each author, ensuring that naturalists for years to come may learn something of their forgotten heritage.

In one of the most audacious works of scholarship ever written, Martin Bernal challenges the foundation of our thinking about this question. Classical civilization, he argues, has deep roots in Afroasiatic cultures. But these Afroasiatic influences have been systematically ignored, denied or suppressed since the eighteenth century&#x2014;chiefly for racist reasons.<br><br> The popular view is that Greek civilization was the result of the conquest of a sophisticated but weak native population by vigorous Indo-European speakers&#x2014;Aryans&#x2014;from the North. But the Classical Greeks, Bernal argues, knew nothing of this &#x201c;Aryan model.&#x201d; They did not see their institutions as original, but as derived from the East and from Egypt in particular.<br><br> This long-awaited third and final volume of the series is concerned with the linguistic evidence that contradicts the Aryan Model of ancient Greece. Bernal shows how nearly 40 percent of the Greek vocabulary has been plausibly derived from two Afroasiatic languages &#x2013; Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic. He also reveals how these derivations are not limited to matters of trade, but extended to the sophisticated language of politics, religion, and philosophy. This evidence, according to Bernal, greatly strengthens the hypothesis that in Greece an Indo-European-speaking population was culturally dominated by Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic speakers.<br><br> Provocative, passionate, and colossal in scope, this volume caps a thoughtful rewriting of history that has been stirring academic and political controversy since the publication of the first volume.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Martin Bernal was a British scholar of modern Chinese political history and a Professor of Government and Near Eastern Studies at Cornell University. His celebrated<i> Black Athena</i> trilogy is a controversial series which argues that Ancient Greek civilization and language are Eastern and Egyptian in origin.<br> &nbsp;Martin Bernal&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Black Athena</i>&nbsp;is nothing short of a monumental achievement in scholarship that re-oriented and transformed serious study of ancient civilizations. It remains a soaring accomplishment of classical erudition of the Afroasiatic foundation of Greek history. (Molefi Kete Asante <i>author of The History of Africa,Professor, Department of Africology, Temple University</i>)<br><br>"In a spectacular undertaking, Martin Bernal sets out to... restore the credibility of what he calls the Ancient Model of the beginnings of Greek civilizations... Bernal makes an exotic interloper in Classical studies. He comes to them with two outstanding gifts: a remarkable flair for the sociology - perhaps one should say politics - of knowledge, and a formidable linguistic proficiency... The story told by Bernal, with many fascinating twists and turns and quite a few entertaining digressions, is... a critical inquiry into a large part of the European imagination... a retrospect of ingenious and often sardonic erudition." (Perry Anderson <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>"An astonishing work, breathtakingly bold in conception and passionately written... salutary, exciting, and, in its historiographical aspects, convincing." (G. W. Bowersock <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br>"A work which has much to offer the lay reader, and its multi-disciplinary sweep is refreshing: it is an important contribution to historiography and the sociology of knowledge, written with elegance, wit, and self-awareness... a thrilling journey... his account is as gripping a tale of scholarly detection and discovery as one could hope to find." (Margaret Drabble <i>The Observer</i>)<br><br>"Bernal's material is fascinating, his mind is sharp, and his analyses convince." (Richard Jenkyns <i>Times Higher Educational Supplement</i>)<br><br>"A formidable work of intellectual history, one that demonstrates that the politics of knowledge is never far from national politics." (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>"His book should be welcome to both classicists and ancient historians, most of whom will, now at least, be inclined to agree with him." (R. A. McNeal <i>Franklin and Marshall College</i>)<br><br>"Bernal's work and the stir it has occasioned have caused ancient historians and archaeologists to undertake a major reexamination of methods and motives." (Robert L. Pounder <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Colossal.... Bernal aims to revise current understanding of Ancient Middle Eastern history by taking seriously the ancient Greeks' legends that portrayed much in their civilization as originating in the Middle East, especially Egypt." (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Demands to be taken seriously... Every page that Bernal writes is educating and enthralling.

She enjoyed the school, where she made numerous friends and where everyone seemed to make a fuss over her. Mornings in the Tully household were underscored by Jeri&#x2019;s enthusiasm to get moving.</p><p>Walhalla was thirty-five miles away. The family had an arrangement with the school district, which was spread out over too vast an area to operate buses for the special-education kids: The Tullys provided their own transportation, and the district absorbed the expenses.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s mother had actually grown to enjoy the daily round-trip. The child loved to ride, and she was never happier than when in the car. The other half of the drive, when Mom was alone, served as a quiet time, when she could just watch the long fields roll by, or plug an audio book into the system.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s father worked the midnight shift that night, and his wife was waiting for him when he got home in the morning with French toast, bacon, and coffee. While they were at breakfast, an odd thing happened. For the only time in her life, Jeri wandered away from home. It seemed, later, that she had decided to go to school and, having no concept of distance, had begun walking.</p><p>Unseen by anyone except a two-year-old brother, she put on her overshoes and her coat, let herself out through the porch door, walked up to Route 11, and turned right. Her house was on the extreme western edge of town, so she got past the demolished Dairy Queen and across the interstate overpass within minutes. The temperature, which is exceedingly erratic in April, had fallen back into the teens.</p><p>Three-quarters of a mile outside Fort Moxie, Route 11 curves sharply south and almost immediately veers west again. Had the road been free of snow, Jeri would probably have stayed with the highway and been picked up within a few minutes. But a light snowfall had dusted the highway. She wasn&#x2019;t used to paying attention to details and, at the first bend, she walked straight off the road. When, a few minutes later, the snow got deeper, she angled right and got still farther away.</p><p>Jeri&#x2019;s parents had by then discovered she was missing. A frightened search was just getting started, but it was limited to within a block or so of her home.</p><p>Jim Stuyvesant, the editor and publisher of the <i>Fort Moxie News</i>, was on his way to the Roundhouse. Rumors that an apparition had come through from the other side were going to be denied that morning in a press conference, and Jim planned to be there. He was just west of town when he saw movement out on Josh McKenzie&#x2019;s land to his right: A small whirlwind was gliding back and forth in a curiously regular fashion. The wind phenomenon was a perfect whirlpool, narrow at the base, wide at the top. Usually, these things were blurred around the edges, and they floated erratically across the plain. But this one looked almost solid, and it moved methodically back and forth along a narrow track.</p><p>Stuyvesant pulled off the road and stopped to watch.</p><p>It was almost hypnotic. A stiff blast of air rocked the car, enough to blow the small whirlwind to pieces. But it remained intact.</p><p>Stuyvesant never traveled without his video camera, which he had used on several occasions to get material he&#x2019;d subsequently sold to <i>Ben at Ten</i> or to one of the other local TV news shows. (He had, for example, got superb footage of the Thanksgiving Day pileup on I-29, and the blockade of imported beef at the border port by angry ranchers last summer.) The floater continued to glide back and forth in its slow, unwavering pattern. He turned on the camera, walked a few steps into the field, and started to record.</p><p>He used the zoom lens to get close and got a couple of minutes&#x2019; worth before the whirlwind seemed to pause.</p><p>It started toward him.</p><p>He kept filming.</p><p>It approached at a constant pace. There was something odd in its manner, something almost deliberate.</p><p>A sudden burst of wind out of the north ripped at his jacket but didn&#x2019;t seem to have any effect on the thing. Stuyvesant&#x2019;s instincts began to sound warnings, and he took a step back toward the car.</p><p>It stopped. Remained still in the middle of the field.</p><p>Amazing. As if it had responded to him.</p><p>He stood, uncertain how to proceed. It began to move again, laterally. It retreated a short distance, then came forward again to its previous position.</p><p>He watched it through the camera lens. The red indicator lamp glowed at the bottom of the picture.</p><p>You&#x2019;re waiting for me.</p><p>It approached again, and a sudden burst of wind tugged at his collar and his hair.</p><p>He took a step forward. And it retreated.</p><p>Like everyone else in the Fort Moxie area, Stuyvesant had been deluged with fantastic tales and theories since the Roundhouse had been uncovered, with its pathways to other worlds. Now, without prompting, he wondered whether a completely unknown type of life-form existed on the prairie and was revealing itself to him. He laughed at the idea. And began to wonder what he really believed.</p><p>He started forward.</p><p>It withdrew before him, matching his pace.</p><p>He kept going. The snow got deeper, filled his shoes, and froze his ankles.</p><p>It hovered before him. He hoped he was getting the effect on camera.</p><p>It whirled and glittered in the sun, maintaining its distance. He stopped, and it stopped. He started again, and it matched him.</p><p>Another car was slowing down, pulling off the highway. He wondered how he would explain this, and immediately visualized next week&#x2019;s headline in the <i>News</i>: MAD EDITOR PUT UNDER GUARD.</p><p>But it was a hunt without a point. The fields went on, all the way to Winnipeg. Far enough, he decided. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, aloud. &#x201c;This is as far as I go.&#x201d;</p><p>And the thing withdrew another sixty or so yards. And collapsed.</p><p>When it did, it revealed something dark lying in the snow.</p><p>Jeri Tully.</p><p>That was the day Stuyvesant got religion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>O&#x2019;er the hills and far away.</p><p>&#x2014;Thomas D&#x2019;Urfey, <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, 1719</p><p>EVEN THOUGH HE&#x2019;D seen the eerie green glow atop the mountain almost every night on TV, Brad Hollister was still surprised that evening as the hills got out of the way, and he saw it for the first time through his windshield. It was easy to understand why people had panicked a few weeks earlier, had thought it was radioactivity and fled the area. They were mostly back now, of course, assured by official sources that the radiation was not hazardous. The world had been shocked when a structure thousands of years old had been excavated on the Sioux reservation near Devils Lake in North Dakota. And shocked again when, a few days later, it began to emit that soft green light. And completely rattled when investigators discovered it was a star gate. That was the capability, of course, that stayed in the headlines. And kept the phones ringing at <i>Grand Forks Live</i>, Brad&#x2019;s call-in show on KLYM.</p><p>Scientific teams had been transported to three locations, a garden world that the media immediately branded &#x201c;Eden,&#x201d; a second location that seemed to be nothing more than a series of passageways in a structure that had no windows, and a deserted space station that appeared to be located outside the Milky Way.</p><p>Missions were going out regularly, mostly to Eden and the station. A team of eight journalists, accompanied by two Sioux security escorts, were on Eden now, expected to return that evening. And a group of scientists were scheduled to head for the same destination within the hour. Brad&#x2019;s callers wanted him to make the trip, and he&#x2019;d been assuring them he would eventually. But before he climbed onto the circular stone, with its gridwork surface, and allowed them to send him off to another world, he wanted to <i>watch </i>the operation. Not that he was scared.</p><p>The emerald glow brightened as he drew near on Route 32. Eventually, he turned off onto a side road, cleared a police unit, and began the long climb to the summit. A bright moon hung over the sparse land, and a bitter wind rocked the car. Eventually, as he approached the summit, the Roundhouse became visible. A bubble dome, it stood on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the vast sweep of land that had once contained Lake Agassiz. Thousands of years ago, Agassiz had covered most of North Dakota and a large section of Canada.</p><p>The building lay below the level of the surrounding granite. Someone had gouged a space in the rock to make room for the Roundhouse. Brad&#x2019;s callers were entranced by the theory that the construction had been orchestrated to place the star gate level with the ancient shoreline. Curved struts anchored it in the rock. The surface resembled a beveled emerald plastic.</p><p>It was surrounded by several temporary structures, which had been erected to support the science teams and the security effort. The area was sealed off by a wired fence. A gateway provided access to cars and trucks.</p><p>The gates were down. Brad lowered his window as he pulled alongside the security booth. A young man in a dark blue Sioux uniform looked out.</p><p>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Hollister,&#x201d; Brad said, handing over his driver&#x2019;s license. &#x201c;They know I&#x2019;m coming.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer checked the ID, touched a computer screen, nodded, and gave it back. &#x201c;Okay, Mr. Hollister,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Park wherever you like.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>A SECURITY GUARD opened the front door for him. He proceeded down a short passageway, past several doors, and entered the dome. This would have been the place that filled with water at high tide, allowing the occupants to take a boat out onto Lake Agassiz. That, of course, was very likely the boat found recently buried on Tom Lasker&#x2019;s farm, which had led to the discovery.</p><p>There were about twenty people, plus three or four uniformed security guards, standing around talking, a few seated at a table. Most were casually dressed, as if preparing for a camping trip. There was also a TV team. A second entrance opened into the chamber from the far side, where everyone was gathered. During the Agassiz years, it would have provided the access for the incoming tide. It had also been, according to the experts, the preferred entrance for the original occupants, the front door, looking out onto a beach. April Cannon was near the transporter, talking with a reporter. The transporter consisted of a circular grid, large enough to have supported Lasker&#x2019;s boat, and a control device, mounted several feet away on the wall.</p><p>April had been the source of his invitation to come in and watch. Brad had known her a long time. She held a doctorate in biochemistry and was a director for Colson Labs, the last time he&#x2019;d looked. She&#x2019;d been conscripted by Sioux Chairman James Walker to coordinate the off-world missions, and, as she put it, that had overwhelmed everything else in her life. April had been a guest on <i>Grand Forks Live </i>a couple of times. When she saw him come in, she excused herself and started in his direction.</p><p>April was an attractive young African-American, with her hair draped around her shoulders, animated features, scintillating eyes, and a persuasive manner. Brad had always suspected that, had she gone into sales instead of chemistry, she would have been wealthy by then. &#x201c;Perfect timing, Brad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some people coming in any minute now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, April. Where are they now? Eden?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. They&#x2019;re all media types. After they get back, we&#x2019;ll be sending out a team of scientists. Biologists and astronomers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have they figured out where the place is yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Maybe we&#x2019;ll get lucky, and they&#x2019;ll do it tonight.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;We know it&#x2019;s pretty far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it would have to be.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. And turned away. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s starting.&#x201d; The front area, near the transport device, brightened though Brad could see no source for the light. &#x201c;Anyway, glad to see you, Brad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The show&#x2019;s about to start.&#x201d; She went back to the transporter and joined one of the Sioux, who seemed to be in charge of overseeing the recovery process. A wave of excitement swept through the crowd. A few people started moving closer to the stone grid. The security guards moved in to keep them at a distance.</p><p>A TV camera approached, and its lights went on. The illumination was directly over the grid. It expanded into a cloud, and Brad thought he could see something moving inside it. Everybody was leaning forward.</p><p>The light kept getting brighter. The cloud enveloped the grid. Then it stalled and simply floated there, so bright it was difficult to look at. And, finally, it began to fade.</p><p>It left someone standing on the grid. A young woman in a security uniform. &#x201c;Welcome home, Andrea,&#x201d; said April, as the cloud disappeared.</p><p>It was Andrea Hawk, who, like Brad, ran a call-in show when she wasn&#x2019;t on duty at the Roundhouse. She got some applause, waved to the audience, and stepped quickly out of the way. Moments later, the light was back.</p><p>Another woman, this time in fatigues, wearing a knapsack and a hat that would have made Indiana Jones proud, emerged. &#x201c;Aleen Rynsburger,&#x201d; said a guy standing off to one side. Brad knew the name. She was a <i>Washington Post </i>columnist.</p><p>One by one they came back, seven reporters and one more security escort. All with wide-brimmed hats. He was relieved to see the process didn&#x2019;t look like a big deal. The light comes on, and somebody steps out and waves to the a...</p></p><h2>Thunder of Heaven (Martyr&#39;s Song, Book 3)</h2><p><p>The world's worst fears have dawned. Nothing stands in the way of total destruction...except the love of one woman.</p><p>Deep in the Amazon jungle a young American woman and the son of plantation owners fall madly in love. For Tanya and Shannon, life is a paradise most only dream about. But today paradise ends. The jungle has hatched more than idyllic love. It has also spawned insidious evil. An evil shrouded in a plot so diabolically brilliant that all of America will be brought to her knees at the hands of a few terrorists. The plan is executed to perfection. There is no way out...save an ancient woman whose dark past has lead her to a life of prayer in preparation for the unspeakable terror about to be unleashed.</p></p><p>Novelist Ted Dekker spins an action-packed story of drug cartels, the CIA, and the power of God to redeem tragedy for good in his inspirational thriller <i>Thunder of Heaven</i>. Life in Venezuela holds nothing but good things for Tanya Vandervan, her missionary family, and her love interest, the musclebound Shannon Ritcherson, who lives with his parents on an adjoining coffee plantation. When terrorists take over the land, both families are murdered and Tanya and Shannon believe each other to be dead. Grieving her losses, Tanya moves to the United States, where she changes her identity and seeks to lay her nightmarish past to rest. Years later, Tanya is inexorably pulled back to Venezuela by visions from God, and finds that Casius, an assassin who has his own agenda for revenge, may hold the key to questions about her past and her future. Dekker relies on a fast-paced plot rather than finely crafted prose to move his story along, and those who like their novels served up with plenty of heroics and a dash of romance will find this an engaging tale. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><p>Since 1997, Ted Dekker has written full-time. He states that each time he writes, he finds his understanding of life and love just a little clearer and his expression of that understanding a little more vivid. Dekker's body of work includes <i>Heaven's Wager</i>, <i>When Heaven Weeps</i>, <i>Thunder of Heaven</i>, <i>Blessed Child</i>, <i>A Man Called Blessed</i>, <i>Blink</i>, <i>Thr3e</i>, The Circle Series: <i>Black</i>, <i>Red</i>, <i>White</i>, <i>Green</i> (a prequel), and <i>Obsessed</i>.</p></p><h2>The First Fifty Years of Relief Society: Key Documents in Latter-day Saint Women&#39;s History</h2><p><b>The groundbreaking book that Harvard professor Laurel Thatcher Ulrich has called "the most important work to emerge from the Mormon press in the last fifty years."</b><br><br>This collection of original documents explores the fascinating and largely unknown history of the Relief Society in the nineteenth century. The story begins with the founding of the Nauvoo Female Relief Society, and the complete and unabridged minutes of that organization are reproduced in this book for the first time in print. The large majority of the volume covers the lesser-known period after the Relief Society was reestablished in territorial Utah and began to spread to areas as remote as Hawaii and England. Not only did Relief Society women care for their families and the poor, they manufactured and sold goods, went to medical school, gave healing blessings and set apart Relief Society officers, stored grain, built assembly halls, fought for women's suffrage, founded a hospital, defended the practice of plural marriage, and started the Primary and Young Women organizations. Prominent in the documents are the towering figures of Mormon women's history from this period, including Emma Smith, Eliza R. Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, Zina D. H. Young, and many others.</p><p>This collection of original documents explores the largely unknown nineteenth-century history of the Relief Society, the women's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Founded in 1842 in Nauvoo, Illinois, the Relief Society was initially led by Emma Smith, wife of church president Joseph Smith. The substantial minutes of the organization's proceedings from 1842 to 1844, published unabridged herein for the first time in print, document the women's priorities, contributions, and teachings. The Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book also contains six sermons Joseph Smith delivered to the society, the only recorded words he directed exclusively to the women of the church.<br>&nbsp;<br>The organization was suspended from 1845 until the mid-1850s, when attempts were made to organize the Relief Society on a congregational level in some areas of Utah Territory after the emigration of the Latter-day Saints to the American West. A more general and permanent reorganization began in 1867, under the leadership of Eliza R. Snow, and the Relief Society's roles within the church structure and within women's lives expanded over the succeeding decades.<br>&nbsp;<br>The example of the Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book helped create a record-keeping sensibility among Latter-day Saint women,who conscientiously created thousands of official and private records during the nineteenth century. The seventy-eight key documents in this collection include minutes of meetings, sermons by both women and men, annual reports from local Relief Societies, newspaper articles and editorials, political petitions and speeches, poetry, letters, journal entries, and reminiscences. They were produced not only near church headquarters but in far-flung settlements in the Mountain West and in areas as remote as Hawaii and England.<br>&nbsp;<br>These records from the first fifty years of Relief Society give insight not only into the spiritual and ecclesiastical dimensions of Latter-day Saint women's lives but also into their political,temporal, and social pursuits. Relief Society women cared for their families and the poor. They manufactured and sold goods, worked as midwives and doctors,gave healing blessings, appointed and set apart Relief Society officers, stored grain, built assembly halls, fought for woman suffrage, founded a hospital,defended the practice of plural marriage, and started the church organizations for children and young women.<br>&nbsp;<br>Prominent in the documents are the towering figures of Mormon women's history from this period--Emma Smith, Eliza R. Snow, Sarah M. Kimball, Mary Isabella Horne, Emmeline B. Wells, Zina D. H. Young, and many others. In addition, some two thousand lesser-known Latter-day Saints appear in these records. Each document has been meticulously transcribed and is placed in historical context with an introduction and annotation. Taken together,the accounts featured here allow readers to study this founding period in Latter-day Saint women's history and to situate it within broader themes in nineteenth-century American religious history."This remarkable collection is not only a landmark in Mormon historical editing, it is a signal contribution to religious studies, women's history, and the economic and social history of the American West. In my view it is the most important work to emerge from the Mormon press in the last fifty years. With quiet authority and without special pleading, it offers an accessible foundation for assessing the position of Latter-day Saint women in the nineteenth century and today."<br>Laurel Thatcher Ulrich<br>300th Anniversary University Professor, Harvard University<br><br>"Scholarship on Mormon women's history continues to burgeon, and this outstanding volume on the early history of the Relief Society is possibly the most significant and exciting contribution of its kind. The editors have done a superb job of pairing richly detailed primary sources with accessible scholarly commentary on Mormon women's history, making the volume suitable for historical specialists and curious newcomers alike. More broadly, this collection reminds us of the many ways that women have worked to make male-led traditions their own. The book is a genuine treasure for scholars and students of American religious history."<br>R. Marie Griffith<br>John C.

For one thing, there are the patterns she's noticing everywhere&#x2014;like how charming-on-the-outside Richard keeps playing scary pranks on her, and how annoying copycat Lynn always has to follow what everyone else is doing. Then there's the pattern of graffiti that keeps appearing on the wall by her school&#x2014;could those numbers be a code meant for Tess? Is it up to her to find out what they mean? And most importantly, if Damien keeps up with his pattern of waiting for her after school, does it mean he likes her? Or is that just a coincidental system?</p><p>Tess looks for formulas to help her figure it all out, but she's afraid there may be none. Sometimes you have to make up your own solutions.</p><p>Sometimes, you just have to risk it.</p></p><p><p>Wendy Lichtman writes personal essays for the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>New York Times</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and <em>Good Housekeeping</em>, among other national publications. She has also written four previous young adult novels, including <em>Do the Math: Secrets, Lies, and Algebra</em>. She holds a degree in mathematics and has tutored public-school students in algebra for several years. When she decided to write about a teenage girl who realizes that some questions have more than one right answer, algebra, with its unknowns and variables, seemed a perfect metaphor. Wendy Lichtman lives in Berkeley, California.</p>Grade 5&#x2013;9&#x2014;This sequel to <i>Do the Math: Secrets, Lies, and Algebra</i> (HarperCollins, 2007) picks up the story of Tess, an eighth grader who copes with uncertain situations and unpredictable people by applying mathematical equations or symbols, an approach that gives her comfort and perspective. After seeing a series of numbers graffitied on a building near school, Tess recognizes that it is a math puzzle and solves it to reveal a secret code. When she decodes the word "arson," she realizes that someone is trying to communicate shocking information to her (there has recently been an unexplained fire at school). Though aware of the punishment for defacing property, she writes her own message on the wall in an attempt to get more information. She eventually solves the mystery, but ends up getting more than she bargained for when she is caught and must face the consequences. She also wrestles with peer relationships as she deals with a boy who is tormenting her and tries to figure out contradictions in a new friend. Lichtman cleverly incorporates mathematical concepts into Tess's narrative, keeping the ideas simple and explaining them in terms that readers can understand. Tess is likable and navigates through her problems in a realistic manner.&#x2014;<i>Amelia Jenkins, Juneau Public Library, AK</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the plough to artificial intelligence, from Gillette&#x2019;s disposable razor to IKEA&#x2019;s Billy bookcase, bestselling author and&nbsp;<i>Financial Times</i>&nbsp;columnist Tim Harford recounts each invention&#x2019;s own curious, surprising, and memorable story.&nbsp;<br><br> Invention by invention, Harford reflects on how we got here and where we might go next. He lays bare often unexpected connections: how the bar code undermined family corner stores, and why the gramophone widened inequality. In the process, he&nbsp;introduces characters who developed some of these inventions, profited from them, and were ruined by them, as he traces the principles that helped explain their transformative effects.

Every night, at a rundown tavern with a magnificent bar called the Cedar Tavern, an extraordinary group or painters, writers, poets, and hangers-on arrive to drink, argue, tell jokes, fight, start affairs, and bang out a powerful new aesthetic. Their style is playful, irreverent, tradition-shattering, and brilliant. Out of these friendships, and these conversations, will come the works of art and poetry that will define New York City as the capital of world culture--abstract expressionism and the New York School of Poetry.<br><br>A richly detailed portrait of one of the great movements in American arts and letters, <b>The Last Avant-Garde</b> covers the years 1948-1966 and focuses on four fast friends--the poets Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler, John Ashbery, and Kenneth Koch. Lehman brings to vivid life the extraordinary creative ferment of the time and place, the relationship of great friendship to art, and the powerful influence that a group of visual artisits--especially Jane Freilicher, Larry Rivers, and Fairfield Porter--had on the literary efforts of the New York School.<br><br><b>The Last Avant-Garde</b> is both a definitive and lively view of a quintessentially American aesthetic and an exploration of the dynamics of creativity.</p><p>Anyone who thinks that avant-garde movements can flourish only in Left Bank caf�s would do well to read David Lehman's superb new book. Lehman, an editor, essayist, and poet, zeroes in on four extraordinary poets--John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, and James Schuyler--who were friends, rivals, sometime collaborators, and passionate appreciators of each other's work from the late 1940s through the mid 1960s. This "remarkable gang of four" was, in Lehman's opinion, not only a true avant-garde--collective creators of new, subversive, nonmainstream art--but also "the last authentic avant-garde movement that we have had in American poetry." It's an ambitious thesis, but Lehman pulls it off in a narrative compounded of cultural history, biography, literary analysis, and great gossip.<p> Most fascinating are Lehman's insights into the inspiration that the poets found in the lives and works of contemporary painters--waggering abstract expressionist artists like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the gentler figurative painters Fairfield Porter, Larry Rivers, and Jane Freilicher, who came after them. As Ashbery put it, "The artists liked us and bought us drinks and we ... felt that they ... were free to be free in their painting in a way that most people felt was impossible for poetry." But each poet made it possible in his own way--Ashbery through surreal word collages, Koch through the pursuit of happiness in verse, O'Hara in witty telephonic stream of consciousness, and Schuyler by treating his feelings as objects. Lehman calls his book a study of "the bliss of being alive and young at a moment of maximum creative ferment," and that bliss fairly shimmers on the page. <i>The Last Avant-Garde</i>, a remarkable hybrid, succeeds in being both critically acute and luminously exciting. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>"[P]ertinent and lucid....a highly readable and fittingly hybridized book: part cultural history, part speculative essay, part literary criticism, part biography."<br>--Daniel Kunitz, <i>The New York Observer</i><p></p></p><h2>Brush with Acrylics: Painting the Easy Way</h2><p>Acrylics are easy to master and extremely versatile.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p><h2>First Lady (Wynette, Texas, 4)</h2><p><p>How does the most famous woman in the world hide in plain sight? The beautiful young widow of the President of the United States thought she was free of the White House, but circumstances have forced her back into the role of First Lady. Not for long, however, because she's made up her mind to escape -- if only for a few days -- so she can live the life of an ordinary person. All she needs is the perfect disguise . . . and she's just found it.</p><p>An entire nation is searching for her, but the First Lady is in the last place anybody would think to look: in the company of a man, an infuriatingly secretive and quietly seductive stranger whose charm, good looks, and sensuous appeal are awakening the forgotten woman within the dignitary. And with two adorable little orphaned girls in need of a family along for the ride, they're heading out across the heartland chasing their own American Dream -- on a wild journey of love, adventure, and glorious rebirth.</p><p>First Lady: A star-spangled, richly emotional story of self-discovery, celebrity, love, and family.</p></p><p>Setting: Contemporary eastern and midwestern America<br> Sensuality: 7<p> Daughter of a powerful politician and widow of an assassinated president, Cornelia (Nealy) Litchfield Case has spent her entire life under Secret Service and media scrutiny. When her father insists that she continue the first lady's social duties for the new bachelor president, she instead resolves to break out of her glamorous prison and live life as a normal American. She knows that she can't elude the Secret Service forever, but every moment of anonymity is priceless.</p><p> Mat Jorik is a pushover for a female in trouble. When his ex-wife dies and leaves him her two daughters, he agrees to drive them from the East Coast to their grandmother's Iowa home. They haven't gone far when he takes pity on another female and offers her a ride in return for her care of the baby and teenager. Nealy accepts his offer. Little does she know when she climbs into the Winnebago that she's about to lose her heart to two kids and a handsome man who she thinks is a steelworker. When Nealy discovers his real job, Mat may wish he'd confessed earlier. In the meantime, they're off on an adventure, the likes of which Nealy's never had before. But the Secret Service is hot on Nealy's trail and despite her best efforts, she's bound to be caught. The question is, what will happen to this slapdash family when they're found?</p><p> Wonderful characters are what you expect from Phillips, and that's exactly what you get here: a heroine with strong convictions about everything from letting a baby eat cheese curls off the floor to morals in politics; a hero who adamantly denies that he likes females even as he's saving and taking care of them; and two children that will pluck your heartstrings like they've never been plucked before. They spar their way through a wild trip on the road to happiness, making for a book that's funny, romantic, and just plain fun to read. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p>9 cds</p><h2>Out of the Depths: Women&#39;s Experience of Evil and Salvation</h2><p>Whether understood as sin, as embracing all manner of suffering and injustice, or as the inexplicable human choice of evil over good, evil has historically been described and pondered chiefly through male categories understood as a universal viewpoint. Likewise salvation. Gebara here presents an alternative, feminist approach to evil and salvation. She allows women to voice their personal suffering from their own contexts, thereby manifesting their many differences. She then introduces a perspective on evil and salvation based in gender analysis to address specifically &#34;the evil women do,&#34; the evil they suffer, and women&#39;s redemptive experiences of God and salvation.</p><p>Gebara, a Brazilian Sister of Our Lady-Canonesses of Saint Augustine, is a visiting professor of feminist theology throughout Latin and North America and Europe.</p><h2>Restless: Bloomsbury Modern Classics</h2><p><p><b>A beautiful new limited edition paperback of <i>Restless</i>, published as part of the Bloomsbury Modern Classics list</b></p><p><i>She continued her cross-examination and watched Romer's pleasure grow; he was enjoying this, she saw, and his enjoyment began to anger her.

Her British spymaster, and lover, Lucas Romer, betrays Eva, and she must assume other identities to escape Romer's death sentence.

Most evangelical teaching about the life of Jesus begins with the Gospel of John, and Christian teaching on the end times relies heavily on the book of Revelation. Students, pastors, and lay learners need solid, up-to-date resources like this book to responsibly study and understand John&#x2019;s writings. C. Marvin Pate addresses John&#x2019;s writings according to their logical divisions: the Gospel of John, the Johannine Epistles, and Revelation. Each section includes a thorough introduction to relevant interpretive issues, including historical background, cultural setting, and theological context. Pate presents a two-fold historical setting for John&#x2019;s gospel, encouraging readers to consider the text from the perspective of Jesus&#x2019; day and from John&#x2019;s situation in Asia Minor sixty years later. He examines the Johannine epistles on issues like authorship, audience, and theological perspective. For the Apocalypse, Pate explores the challenges of John&#x2019;s first readers, the nature of apocalyptic literature, and the Roman imperial cult, including as well an explanation of how the church has interpreted Revelation over the years. With its thorough discussion and&nbsp;textbook design, <em>The Writings of John</em> sets the standard for introductory texts on biblical books or collections.</p></p><p>C. Marvin Pate (MA, Wheaton; PhD, Marquette University) taught for thirteen years at Moody Bible Institute. Now he is chair of the department of Christian theology and professor of theology at Ouachita Baptist University.

For over fifty years, these sanctions have been upheld by<br>every presidential administration, and at times intensified by individual<br>presidents and acts of Congress. They are a key part of<br>the U.S. government&#x2019;s ongoing campaign to undermine the Cuban<br>Revolution, and stand in egregious violation of international<br>law. Most importantly, the sanctions are cruelly designed for their<br>harmful impact on the Cuban people.<br>In this concise and sober account, Salim Lamrani explains everything<br>you need to know about U.S. economic sanctions against<br>Cuba: their origins, their provisions, how they contravene international<br>law, and how they affect the lives of Cubans. He examines<br>the U.S. government&#x2019;s own official documents to expose what is<br>hiding in plain sight: an indefensible, vicious, and wasteful blockade<br>that has been roundly condemned by citizens around the<br>world.</p><p><strong>Salim Lamrani </strong>teaches at the University of Paris- Sorbonne Paris IV and the University of la R�union.

There she must claim her inheritance by convincing the artificial intelligence that animates her family&#x2019;s castle that she is, in fact, the new Heterodyne. But this apparently simple task is made complicated in several ways: An imposter claiming to be the legitimate heir appears. The Empire is convinced that Agatha is the person responsible for the Long War (and to be fair, they are not entirely incorrect).

Their decade-long marriage had survived years of war that took Chris, a U.S. Navy SEAL, away from Taya and their two children for agonizingly long stretches while he put his life on the line in many major battles of the Iraq War. After struggling to readjust to life out of the military, Chris had found new purpose in redirecting his lifelong dedication to service to supporting veterans and their families. Their love had deepened, and, most special of all, their family was whole, finally.</p><p>Then, the unthinkable. On February 2, 2013, Chris and his friend Chad Littlefield were killed while attempting to help a troubled vet.&nbsp;The life Chris and Taya fought so hard to build together was shattered. In an instant, Taya became a single parent of two. A widow. A young woman facing the rest of her life without the man she loved.</p><p>Chris and Taya&#x2019;s remarkable story has captivated millions through Clint Eastwood&#x2019;s blockbuster, Academy Award-winning film <em>American</em> <em>Sniper,</em> starring Bradley Cooper as Chris and Sienna Miller as Taya, and because of Chris&#x2019;s bestselling memoir, in which Taya contributed passages that formed the book&#x2019;s emotional core. Now, with trusted collaborator Jim DeFelice, Taya writes in never-before-told detail about the hours, days, and months after his shocking death when grief threatened to overwhelm her. Then there were wearying battles to protect her husband&#x2019;s legacy and reputation.</p><p>And yet throughout, friendship, family, and a deepening faith were lifelines that sustained her and the kids when the sorrow became too much. Two years after her husband&#x2019;s tragic death, Taya has found renewed meaning and connection to Chris by advancing their shared mission of &#x201c;serving those who serve others,&#x201d; particularly military and first-responder families.&nbsp;She and the children now are embracing a new future, one that honors the past but also looks forward with hope, gratitude, and joy.</p><p><em>American Wife</em> is one of the most remarkable memoirs of the year -- a universal chronicle of love and heartbreak, service and sacrifice, faith and purpose that will inspire every reader.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Taya Kyle is executive director of the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation.

Captured here in over 250 vintage images is the human drama of survival and coexistence in the canyon, from the native tribes who struggled with life on the rim, to the pioneers who came to foster and manipulate the early tourist industry in America&#39;s oldest natural resource. Covering the tribes that called the canyon home and the seekers who flocked to the area to find their fortune in gold and tourism, author Kenneth Shields exposes the human layers so often overlooked. Seen here are the native tribes who survived the harshest conditions of the canyon, including the Hopi, Havasupai, Navajo, and Paiute.

But Cain's journey wasn't always easy - and his true arrival in life had more to do with faith than fame.</p><p>As a child, Cain survived a horrific school fire that killed nearly 100 of his classmates. His experience formed a resilience that would carry him through both tragedy and success. Moving from Chicago to Sunset Boulevard, Cain never let go of his dreams, eventually getting his big break with Journey - and writing the songs that would become the soundtrack of a generation.</p><p><em>Don&#x2019;t Stop Believin&#x2019;</em>&nbsp;is an epic story of one man's dream that takes you from playing old-country songs at an Italian Deli in Chicago and his experiences with a warm, encouraging father who died too soon, to suddenly writing mega-bestselling songs with some of the most talented musicians and performers ever to take the stage of some of the world's largest arenas.

Under the general editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shapiro, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays.<br>Brought boldly to life by Herbert Golder and Richard Pevear's translation and contextualized by Herbert Golder's eloquent introduction, this early Sophoclean tragedy tells the story of the Homeric hero better known as Ajax, who was second only to Achilles among the Greek warriors. In Greek tradition, Aias figures as the archaic warrior who dies in shame after his betrayal by the Greeks. Sophocles turns tradition inside out, portraying Aias' suicide not as a disgrace but as heroism. He endows Aias suicide with a meaning radically different from previous versions of the Aias myth--Aias is not the hero whom time has passed by, but rather the man who steps beyond time. Most previous versions and interpretations have equivocated over Sophocles' bold vision. This edition of Aias translates precisely that transformation of the hero from the bygone figure to the man who transcends time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Herbert Golder</strong> is Professor of Classics at Boston University. <strong>Richard Pevear</strong> is a poet and translator.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>The Poems of Catullus: A Bilingual Edition</h2><p>Catullus, who lived during some of the most interesting and tumultuous years of the late Roman Republic, spent his short but intense life (?84-54 B.C.E.) in high Roman society, rubbing shoulders with various cultural and political luminaries, including Caesar, Cicero, and Pompey. Catullus's poetry is by turns ribald, lyric, romantic, satirical; sometimes obscene and always intelligent, it offers us vivid pictures of the poet's friends, enemies, and lovers. The verses to his friends are bitchy, funny, and affectionate; those to his enemies are often wonderfully nasty. Many poems brilliantly evoke his passionate affair with Lesbia, often identified as Clodia Metelli, a femme fatale ten years his senior and the smart, adulterous wife of an arrogant aristocrat. Cicero later claimed she poisoned her husband. <br><br>This new bilingual translation of Catullus's surviving poems by Peter Green is fresh, bawdy, and utterly engaging. Unlike its predecessors, it adheres to the principle that the rhythm of a poem, whether familiar or not, is among the most crucial elements for its full appreciation. Green provides an essay on the poet's life and literary background, a historical sketch of the politically fraught late Roman Republic in which Catullus lived, copious notes on the poems, a wide-ranging bibliography for further reading, and a full glossary.</p><p>"Peter Green is an outstanding translator. The reader&#x2019;s excited anticipation of pleasure and instruction on receiving a new translation of a Latin poet by Green is not disappointed. This is a labor of love which makes Catullus accessible to the Latinless reader and more familiar to those who can read Latin."&#x2015;Susan Treggiari, Stanford University<br><br>"For almost half a century Peter Green has been one of the finest of all modern translators of classical verse. His Catullus is well up to his usual form&#x2015;recapturing for a contemporary audience the wit, malice, erudition and erotic charm of the Latin original."&#x2015;Mary Beard, author of <i>The Parthenon</i><b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and Adjunct Professor of Classics at the University of Iowa.

Combining advances in molecular biology and genomics with mathematical and empirical findings from population genetics, work in molecular population genetics has uncovered the extraordinary history of natural selection and demographic shifts in many organisms, including humans. While basic descriptions of the methods and tools of this field can be found in disparate places, no previous book has brought them together in a single volume. Rather than cobble together pieces from books, reviews, and primary research articles, <em>Molecular Population Genetics</em> presents a coherent user's guide to the field. Intended as a text for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, the book will also be useful as a detailed reference for active professionals.<br></p><p><br><strong>Matthew W.

This term refers to people who are at risk of being pathologized and oppressed both outside and inside the clinical setting due to their gender identities, sexual orientations, or sexual practices.</p> <p>The book outlines nine principles for therapeutic practice which meet the needs of erotically marginalized clients, whose forms of sexuality and desire are rarely spoken about and for whom there is a dearth of language in therapeutic contexts. Each principle concludes with a series of &#x2018;key points&#x2019; and then followed by illustrative clinical case studies, contributed by sex therapists and clinicians who self-identify as erotically marginalized and who also work with erotically marginalized clients. The book also provides a full glossary, &#x2018;Defining Erotically Marginalized Identities&#x2019;.</p> <p>The authors and case contributors use a radical and affirming lens to examine erotically marginalized identities that are often neglected. The book bridges gaps between the past, present, and future in the field of sex therapy and greatly expands the diversity of experiences and identities within the field, particularly the experience of multiple oppressions.</p> <p>The book marks a valuable contribution not only to sex therapists but to the wider clinical and therapeutic community.</p></p><p><p><strong>Damon M.

Principles are helpfully divided into sections focusing on foundations, practice, and systems, which help the reader to explore how they might work ethically and with integrity, for example by naming systemic oppressions, by challenging binary thinking, by emphasizing clients' own narratives, and by practising active allyship within wider communities.

This book explores, in an engaging and in-depth manner, the experiences of and therapeutic principles for working with erotically marginalized clients. A unique and indispensable component of the text is the use of powerful and detailed clinical vignettes, which not only describe clients but also illuminate the therapists&#x2019; own process. Practical advice is provided throughout the book&#x2015;yet this advice is far from a set of simplified steps of &#x2018;what to do.&#x2019; Rather, the authors engage the reader in the gritty realness of working as real people with real clients, and their advice is informed by and reflects that realness, in all its messy and complex glory. The contributors are diverse in their intersectional identities and personal and professional experiences, and the style and content of the chapters mirror that diversity. The result is an eclectic collection of perspectives and content, whereby a reader does not necessarily have to read the entire book in order or in its entirety to effectively use and benefit from it. Careful explanation of key terms, and the inclusion of user-friendly clinical resources and forms, are also key features of the book.

Readers are invited to consider the profound issues and penetrating questions that lie beneath this perennially popular body of work as the contributors examine the art world of late nineteenth-century France&#x2015;including detailed looks at Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Degas, C�zanne, Morisot, Seurat, Van Gogh, and Gauguin. The authors offer fascinating new perspectives, placing the artworks from this period in wider social and historical contexts. They explore these painters' pictorial and market strategies, the critical reception and modern criteria the paintings engendered, and the movement's historic role in the formation of an avant-garde tradition. Their research reflects the wealth of new documents, critical approaches, and scholarly exhibitions that have fundamentally altered our understanding of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. These essays, several of which have previously been familiar only to scholars, provide instructive models of in-depth critical analysis and of the competing art historical methods that have crucially reshaped the field. <br><br><i>Contributors: Carol Armstrong, T.

Since the events of 9/11 and 7/7, Islam has become one of the most controversial and misunderstood religions in the world.<i> Introducing Islam</i> encourages students to put aside their preconceptions and explore this fascinating religion.</p> <p>William Shepard traces the history of Islam from its origins in the life and career of Mohammed, through its classical expressions, to its interactions with the West in the modern world.

Rocco Gangle, <i>Endicott College, USA</i></p> <p></p> <p>"Shepard provides a comprehensive and intelligible study of Islam, from its origins in the seventh century to its dynamic developments in the medieval periods, providing insight into the manifestations of Islamic civilization beyond theology, such as on art, culture and rituals. Tracing Islam into the modern era, he sketches the complexity of how Islamic societies from the Middle East to Indonesia have confronted the tensions between traditional beliefs and contemporary expressions of Islam. Masterfully, this catholic and lucid discussion of Islam is accomplished without losing any of the sophistication of the topic." Awad Halabi, <em>Wright State University, USA<br><br></em>"This well-articulated presentation of Islam is encyclopaedic but also very approachable &#x2013; appropriately academic, but not mindnumbingly verbose with it. It is an ideal textbook, for introductory texts often run the risk of becoming as repetitive as the Mandelbrot set, but here the author, succinctly and successfully, articulates the issues in an accessible vernacular idiom. Reading good academic books is very much about both information and enjoyment, and ideally literature introducing major world religions should be both educational and a pleasure to read. Shepard has scored well on both." Abdullah Drury<em>, University of Waikato</em></p> <p>"In 21 chapters, the second edition of this book offers a very substantial survey of Islam from its origins to the present... Introductory texts on Islam are not hard to find, but this one has a number of features to recommend it to students and other serious readers, not least its comprehensive coverage and empathetic presentation of Muslims' own perspectives." Christopher van der Krogt, <em>Massey University, New Zealand</em></p> <p>"William Shepard...has released a second edition of Introducing Islam. This book appears to have two broad objectives, firstly to bring to readers an overview of Islamic history, theology and philosophy, and secondly to enter into and address some of the most difficult areas of debate around modern Islam. Shepard is one of those authors who seems to be able to write in a way that will suit various levels of readership. This is both an accessible and sophisticated text."

While we know that nature follows patterns such as the law of gravity our everyday lives are beyond what known science can predict. We nevertheless muddle through even in the absence of theories of how to act. But how do we do it?<br><br>In <i>Probably Approximately Correct</i>, computer scientist Leslie Valiant presents a masterful synthesis of learning and evolution to show how both individually and collectively we not only survive, but prosper in a world as complex as our own. The key is probably approximately correct&#x201d; algorithms, a concept Valiant developed to explain how effective behavior can be learned. The model shows that pragmatically coping with a problem can provide a satisfactory solution in the absence of any theory of the problem. After all, finding a mate does not require a theory of mating. Valiant's theory reveals the shared computational nature of evolution and learning, and sheds light on perennial questions such as nature versus nurture and the limits of artificial intelligence.<br><br>Offering a powerful and elegant model that encompasses life's complexity, <i>Probably Approximately Correct</i> has profound implications for how we think about behavior, cognition, biological evolution, and the possibilities and limits of human and machine intelligence.<br></p><p><b>Leslie Valiant</b> is the T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He is a winner of the Nevanlinna Prize from the International Mathematical Union, and the Turing Award, known as the Nobel of computing.<br>Computer scientist Leslie Valiant celebrates Alan Turing as the progenitor of a third scientific revolution, potentially as profound as Newton's and Einstein's in transforming our understanding of the world. Why not a fourth revolution' why omit Darwin? Because, Valiant dares to say, Darwin's theory is radically incomplete, and until it is equipped to make quantitative, verifiable predictions, evolution by natural selection cannot account for the complexity of living things and is not more than a metaphor.' But Valiant offers no drop of succor to creationists. Rather, he seeks to arm neo-Darwinian theory against their onslaughts by elucidating the mechanistic, quantitative basis it must have in a world without a designer.' The algorithms of computational learning theory, he posits, will be key in particular, a special kind he calls ecorithms,' which incorporate information gathered from the environment to improve an organism's performance.' Turing's heirs have only just begun to plot its equation.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The Scientist</i></b><br><br> Insightful....

His text is clear and approachable, with some work; the argument is sweeping.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Harvard Magazine</i></b><br><br> [Valiant's] major point is that Darwin introduced evolution by natural selection, but the detailed mechanism is still sketchy. A hundred years of genetics has filled in some details, but Valiant sees the computational details as essential and still missing. The goal of this book is to encourage further research and to set a paradigm for such work. As Erwin Schr�dinger's <i>What Is Life?</i> inspired those who built molecular biology, Valiant hopes to inspire those who will build a future computational biology. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Choice</i></b><br><br> This remarkable book is carefully constructed to give the lay person a sense of subtle problems in mathematics and artificial intelligence, and offers a framework for biologists and computer scientists to use in jointly investigating the most fascinating and enigmatic biological questions.&#x201d;<br><b> Marc Kirschner, Chair, Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, and coauthor of <i>The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemma</i></b><br><br> This book contains a lot of fresh thinking and elegant, nuanced ideas.

Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)</h2><p>This companion probes the full depth of Kierkegaard&#39;s thought revealing its distinctive subtlety.

Based on the need to humanize rather than medicalize the illness experience for patients, <i>Palliative Care Nursing: Quality Care to the End of Life, Fifth Edition</i>, delves into palliative care beyond the specific diseases affecting the patient. ICU nursing and ICU style help is impersonal and outdated. Instead, this textbook focuses on the wholesome caregiving to benefit the patient and their support network. <br><br> Palliative patients struggle with debilitating and painful conditions, and because their condition is chronic, they grapple with the fact that life as they knew it has ended. Families and friends also suffer. They don't know how to help and therefore become secondary victims of the disease. Traditionally, ICU units and have focused on just treatment, and patients, family, and friends suffered. Today, modern medical advances have expanded to include empathy, and have learned how to harness the power of an entire team to help the patient and their support network strengthen their resilience, cure what can be cured, and maintain meaning and purpose in life. <br><br> <i>Palliative Care Nursing, Fifth Edition</i> delivers advanced empirical, aesthetic, ethical and personal knowledge. This new edition brings an increased focus on outcomes, benchmarking progress, and goals of care. It expounds upon the importance of the cross-disciplinary collaboration introduced in the previous edition.

African countries seek various answers, and they have recorded varying degrees of success as they attempt to unite their peoples to build strong nations, develop their economies, and stabilize their politics. Failures have equally been recorded in a number of places, although these have not prevented the search for new solutions nor dampened the enthusiasm of Africans in liberating themselves from poverty. Among the leading issues that the volume pays attention to are: the achievements of independence, the colonial legacy, Africa's place in global affairs, economic development, political instability, and the challenges of renewal in the 21st century. <p>This is the fifth volume in a series of textbooks entitled Africa. Contributors to the volumes are African Studies teachers from a variety of schools and settings. Writing from their individual areas of expertise, these authors work together to break stereotypes about Africa, focusing instead on the substantive issues of the African past from the perspectives of Africans themselves. The organization of the books is flexible enough to suit the needs of any instructor, and the texts include illustrations, maps and timelines to make cultural and historical movements clearer. Suggestions for further reading that will help students broaden their own interests are also included. Africa challenges the accepted ways of studying Africa and encourages students who are eager to learn about the diversity of the African experience.</p></p><p>Toyin Falola is the Frances Higginbothom Nalle Centennial Professor in History at the University of Texas, Austin.

The framework allows students to understand strategic marketing as a system where changes in one aspect of the plan affect other aspects, and where strategic decisions have executional consequences. The interrelatedness of the text's 14 modules encourages unity of purpose that results in efficient decision making.</p> <p>Throughout the text, the authors provide a set of materials that will enable students to attack marketing problems by utilizing an integrated framework and associated tools designed to help them analyze, prioritize, and then solve these problems. The simplicity of the Big Picture Framework enables students to &#x201c;practice&#x201d; outside the classroom as well-- finding themselves evaluating marketing problems they encounter in their daily lives through the lens of the Big Picture framework.&nbsp;</p> <p>Properly applied, the framework allows students to reduce the uncertainty associated with marketing decisions, and increase their ability to generate a wider range of solutions to the specific problem. Perhaps more importantly, the framework enables the marketer to assess decisions on an ongoing basis, thereby engaging in a process of continuous evaluation and learning.</p></p><p><b>Christie Nordhielm</b> is an Associates Professor of Marketing at the University of Michigan Business School, where she oversees the core marketing Program and serves as the Director for the Marketing Center of Excellence for Executive Education.

It makes a major contribution to the debate between externalist and internalist philosophies of mind, and breaks radically with the epistemological tradition of analyzing knowledge in terms of true belief. The theory casts new light on such philosophical problems as scepticism, evidence, probability and assertion, realism and anti-realism, and the limits of what can be known. The arguments are illustrated by rigorous models based on epistemic logic and probability theory. The result is a new way of doing epistemology and a notable contribution to the philosophy of mind.<br></p><p><br><strong>Timothy Williamson</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh.<br><br>"The best book in epistemology to come out since 1975"--Keith DeRose, British Journal for the Philosophy of Science<p></p><br>"Newness in philosophy is rare.

This valuable new addition to the acclaimed Oxford Archaeological Guides series provides coverage of all the main archaeological sites in Greece, ranging from prehistory to the sixth century A.D. . The individual sites are arranged by region, and include Philip&#39;s Tomb at Vergina, the Palace complex at Mycenae, the Temples of the Acropolis, the Hellenistic city of the Messene, and the Roman colony of Corinth. Also included in the book are &#39;partner factor&#39; ratings that rank the most worthwhile sites for travelers to visit during their stay. An up-to-date introduction surveys Greece&#39;s landscape, history, and archaeology from the Neolithic period to the end of antiquity, and places the sites in their cultural context. Finally, there is a chronology for reference and a glossary of essential terms.</p><p>In the mid-second century A.D., a widely traveled geographer named Pausanias made an exhaustive survey of the major cities, temples, and byways of Greece, writing one of the world's first travel books in the bargain. Two millennia later, British archaeologists Mee and Spawforth follow in Pausanias's footsteps, correcting and updating his observations and providing clear directions on how to reach such fabled places as Orchomenos, Thermopylae, and Eleusis.<p> Mee and Spawforth write from an on-the-ground point of view, orienting readers toward significant ruins and points of interest at more than a hundred sites. Some of them, such as the Acropolis of Athens, Sparta, and Pylos, are well known to archaeologically inclined travelers; only the most seasoned of them, however, will have attained the authors' knowledge, helpfully shared, of how to gain the best view of Mount Olympos or the Temple of Athena Nike or how to find the Sacred Spring at Corinth. Other sites, such as the Middle Helladic ruins of Tiryns and the Temple of Apollo at Bassai, are somewhat more obscure, but, in the authors' estimation, well worth a visit for their historical and scenic value alike. The book is well illustrated with maps, architectural plans, drawings, and photographs, and includes abundant sidebars that expand on historical and cultural points in the text.</p><p> Mee and Spawforth's book makes a first-rate companion for travelers to Greece, and a useful reference for the home library as well. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Tony Spawforth</strong> is Professor of Ancient History and Greek Archaeology at Newcastle University and Curator of the Shefton Museum of Greek Art there.

The picture of the <i>Virgen morena</i> (Dark Virgin) is to be found everywhere throughout Mexico, and her iconography is varied almost beyond telling. Though innumerable books, both historical and devotional, have been published on the Guadalupan legend in this century alone, it is only recently that its textual sources have been closely studied.</p> <p>This volume makes available to the English-reading public an easily accessible translation from the original Nahuatl of the story itself and the entire book in which the story is embedded. The study also provides scholars with new perspectives on a text long at the center of Mexican intellectual currents.

The first known telling of the tale appeared in a book published in Spanish in 1648 by the priest Miguel S�nchez. On the heels of the S�nchez version, the story was included in the book <i>Huei tlamahui�oltica</i> published in 1649 by Luis Laso de la Vega, the vicar of the Guadalupe chapel and a friend of S�nchez. It had little impact initially, but by the twentieth century, with indigenism triumphant, it had become the best known version.</p> <p>There have been a few translations of Laso de la Vega's apparition story into English but only on a popular or devotional level. The present edition offers a translation and transcription of the complete text of the 1649 edition, together with critical apparatus, including comparisons of the S�nchez and Laso de la Vega texts, and various linguistic, orthographic, and typographical matters that throw light on the date and manner of composition.</p></p><p>The devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of the most important elements in the development of a specifically Mexican tradition of religion and nationality over the centuries.

Here, they deploy a depth of scholarship in explaining the different schools and their key points of departure from one another. This book will be particularly useful to students looking for a clear, non-technical explanation of the main approaches to macroeconomics.'</i><br>- Patrick Minford, Cardiff University, UK <p><i>'There are two steps to learning macroeconomics. First, to see it as it is today. Second, to understand how it got there: to understand the right and the wrong turns, the hypotheses that proved false, the insights that proved true, and the interaction of events and ideas. Only then, does one truly understand macroeconomics. This book is about step two. It does a marvellous job of it. The presentation is transparent, the interviews fascinating. You will enjoy, and you will learn.'</i><br>- Olivier Blanchard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p><p> <i>'In 40 years of teaching macroeconomics, there has been just one textbook that I have assigned year after year after year, namely, </i>A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics<i> by Snowdon, Vane and Wynarczyk. That altogether admirable book made clear to students what were, and are, the main intellectual issues in macroeconomics and did so with just enough formal modeling to avoid distortion by over-simplification. That book is now ten years old and the debate in macro has moved on. So there is good reason to welcome Snowdon and Vane back with this superb updated version.'</i><br>- Axel Leijonhufvud, University of Trento, Italy</p><p><i>'This outstanding book avoids the narrow scope of most textbooks and provides an excellent guide to an unusually broad range of ideas.'</i><br>- Thomas Mayer, University of California, Davis</p><p>More than a decade after the publication of the critically acclaimed <i>A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics</i>, Brian Snowdon and Howard Vane have produced a worthy successor in the form of <i>Modern Macroeconomics</i>. Thoroughly extended, revised and updated, it will become the indispensable text for students and teachers of macroeconomics in the new millennium.</p><p>The authors skillfully trace the origins, development and current state of modern macroeconomics from an historical perspective. They do so by thoroughly appraising the central tenets underlying the main competing schools of macroeconomic thought as well as their diverse policy implications. To reflect the important developments which have occurred in macroeconomics over the final decades of the twentieth century, they also survey the burgeoning literature on the 'new political macroeconomics' and 'economic growth'. The book includes insightful chapters on the Post Keynesian and Austrian schools by Paul Davidson and Roger Garrison, and is enlivened by interviews with leading economists such as Robert Skidelsky, James Tobin, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas Jr, Edward Prescott, Gregory Mankiw, Alberto Alesina, Robert Solow and Paul Romer. The volume also contains an extensive bibliography of over 1,300 publications which highlights the key titles recommended for further student reading.</p><p>Erudite, accessible and lucidly written, this book is both a stimulating introduction and excellent guide to the controversies and diversity of modern macroeconomic debates. It will prove invaluable for students on undergraduate and postgraduate courses who want to understand as well as simply learn about macroeconomics. It is also a book that many teachers and lecturers will want on their shelves.</p></p><p><b>Brian Snowdon</b>, Principal Lecturer in Economics, Newcastle Business School, Northumbria University, UK and <b>Howard R. Vane</b>, Professor of Economics, School of Accounting, Finance and Economics, Liverpool John Moores University, UKSnowdon and Vane's book is extremely welcome. Indeed the authors examine, compare, and evaluate the evolution of the major rival stories comprising contemporary macroeconomic thought, but they also trace the development and interaction of key events and ideas as they occurred in the last century. Interviews with leading economists, one or two at the end of each chapter, also greatly help to shed light on this complexity. . . In sum, this is book which is very difficult to put down. --Alessio Moneta, Journal of the History of Economic Thought<br><br>It is not difficult to understand why this volume commands high praise from macroeconomic theorists, practitioners and teachers. It contains many interesting features that make it an excellent companion for both students and teachers of tertiary level macroeconomics. . . The authors present the material in a way that conveys to readers that macroeconomics is a ''living science'', continually developing and still open to debate, controversy and competing policy prescriptions. In this respect it is a book that ought to be required reading for all teachers of the subject. It is also a valuable source of background reading for professional economists involved with economic policy making. --Economic Outlook and Business Review<br><br>[A] wonderful history of macroeconomic thought from Keynes to the present, with an outstanding bibliography.

The book brings together a team of leading scholars-working both within and beyond the United States-to share powerful, much-needed research that helps us understand the increasingly vexed relationships between race, ethnicity, and language in our rapidly changing world. Combining the innovative, cutting-edge approaches of race and ethnic studies with fine-grained linguistic analyses, authors cover a wide range of topics including the struggle over the very term "African American," the racialized language education debates within the increasing number of "majority-minority" immigrant communities in the U.S., the dangers of multicultural education in a Europe that is struggling to meet the needs of new migrants, and the sociopolitical and cultural meanings of linguistic styles used in Brazilian favelas, South African townships, Mexican and Puerto Rican barrios in Chicago, and Korean American "cram schools" in New York City, among other sites.<br><br>Taking into account rapidly changing demographics in the U.S and shifting cultural and media trends across the globe--from Hip Hop cultures, to transnational Mexican popular and street cultures, to Israeli reality TV, to new immigration trends across Africa and Europe--<em>Raciolinguistics</em> shapes the future of scholarship on race, ethnicity, and language. By taking a comparative look across a diverse range of language and literacy contexts, the volume seeks not only to set the research agenda in this burgeoning area of study, but also to help resolve pressing educational and political problems in some of the most contested raciolinguistic contexts in the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>H.

Building upon Alim &amp; Smitherman's groundbreaking <em>Articulate While Black</em>, Alim et al. continue the paradigm shift in linguistics to 'race language' and 'language race.' The brilliant, and most important, thing about this book is that it presents illuminating, path-breaking analyses that remind us that we ignore the critical role of language at our own peril. <em>Raciolinguistics</em> will undoubtedly become an indispensible contribution to all fields interested in race and ethnicity-and to the broader conversation on race in these 'hyperracial' times." --<strong>Michael Eric Dyson</strong>, University Distinguished Professor of Sociology, and author of <em>Debating Race</em> <br><p></p><br>"This book represents a raciolinguistic revolution by boldly, brilliantly, and unapologetically demonstrating the inextricability of language and race in all domains of social life, from politics and education to media and popular culture. Alim et. al. have produced a cutting-edge collection of rigorous scholarship representing a quantum leap forward in theorizing language and race in sociolinguistics and race/ethnic studies. Whereas "race" has traditionally been forwarded as a 'social construction,' <em>Raciolinguistics</em> makes it plain that this "social construction" is a sociolinguistic one. This book is both a necessary intervention and a ground-breaking intellectual contribution." --<strong>Geneva Smitherman</strong>, University Distinguished Professor Emerita, Michigan State University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Raciolinguistics</em> boldly challenges long-held beliefs about the nature of race and language-and their interconnectedness. By 'racing language' and 'languaging race,' the authors invite new perspectives, challenge orthodoxy, and push all of us to expand our analyses of the social world. Given its global, international reach, this is an agenda-setting book. It not only offers an epistemic rupture from traditional studies of language and race, but it also provides a critically important and much-needed research base for language and education policy makers struggling to create more inclusive, democratic, and just societies in the U.S. and elsewhere." --<strong>Gloria Ladson-Billings</strong>, Kellner Family Distinguished Professor in Urban Education, University of Wisconsin <br><p></p><br>"The collection offers a broad range of topics and perspectives, Western and non-Western. The essays are grouped in three sections: the first focuses on linguistic research, the second looks at race in conjunction with social and political context, and the third addresses race and language in educational settings. Though taking differing approaches, the essays work together toward the same goal, which is to explore the complex relationships between language and race. Discussion of contemporary topics such as rap and hip-hop music, new media, and reality television will appeal to college students (of traditional age), and the writing style throughout the book is relatively approachable. This book is particularly valuable given the transition from Barack Obama's administration to that of Donald Trump, since presidential policies affect not only the US but also the rest of the world."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Alim, Rickford and Ball have assembled an excellent set of essays that challenge the way we construct social reality. The combined force of the book is more than academic. It is a call for action in the political realm and in our personal interactions. There does not appear to be a specific audience for this book (scholars, undergraduates, general public, etc.), but rather the book seems to be intended for anyone who is interested in thinking more deeply about the interplay of race and language. The chapters are nearly uniformly coherent, well written, and pleasurable to read; they are scholarly, yet accessible. It is not hard to imagine this as a text supporting general courses in sociolinguistics or more specialized courses related to race and language. The book admirably introduces readers to a new field of inquiry and opens up vistas for potential future research on the questions it raises." --<em>Linguist List</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition</h2><p>The cigarette is the deadliest artifact in the history of human civilization. It is also one of the most beguiling, thanks to more than a century of manipulation at the hands of tobacco industry chemists. In <i>Golden Holocaust</i>, Robert N. Proctor draws on reams of formerly-secret industry documents to explore how the cigarette came to be the most widely-used drug on the planet, with six trillion sticks sold per year. He paints a harrowing picture of tobacco manufacturers conspiring to block the recognition of tobacco-cancer hazards, even as they ensnare legions of scientists and politicians in a web of denial. Proctor tells heretofore untold stories of fraud and subterfuge, and he makes the strongest case to date for a simple yet ambitious remedy: a ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.</p><p>&#x201c;The great cause of global health is in Robert Proctor&#x2019;s debt. <i>Golden Holocaust</i> is a model of impassioned scholarly research and advocacy.

Lives, far too many lives, depend on what this book contains."--Iain Boal, Birkbeck College, London and Guggenheim Fellow in Science and Technology<br><br>"Robert Proctor draws an unvarnished conclusion: that the tobacco industry, and the men who led it, were evil, plain and simple. They knowingly sold a product that, when used as intended, killed people. And then they conspired to suppress the evidence.

How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world?&#x2015;are at the heart of metaphysics. Rather than try to cover all of the many strands in the philosophy of perception, this book focuses on a particular orthodoxy about the nature of visual perception.</p><p>The central problem for visual science has been to explain how the brain bridges the gap between what is given to the visual system and what is actually experienced by the perceiver. The orthodox view of perception is that it is a process whereby the brain, or a dedicated subsystem of the brain, builds up representations of relevant figures of the environment on the basis of information encoded by the sensory receptors. Most adherents of the orthodox view also believe that for every conscious perceptual state of the subject, there is a particular set of neurons whose activities are sufficient for the occurrence of that state. Some of the essays in this book defend the orthodoxy; most criticize it; and some propose alternatives to it. Many of the essays are classics. </p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>G.E.M.

He expressed the essence of his thought in a series of three pamphlets published in the months leading up to the meeting of the Estates-General in 1789. This volume presents all three essays--<i>Views of the Executive Means</i>, <i>An Essay on Privileges</i>, and <i>What Is the Third Estate?</i>--in their entirety. The third essay, in a new translation by Michael Sonenscher, is followed by Sieyes's 1791 newspaper debate with Tom Paine on the merits of monarchy versus republicanism. Elucidated by Sonenscher's insightful Introduction, these texts will fascinate anyone interested in the history of the French Revolution, the history of social and political thought, or the origins and character of modern liberalism.</p></p><p>Michael Sonenscher is a Fellow and Director of Studies in History, King&#39;s College, University of Cambridge.<p>This new English edition of some of Sieyes' key texts is to be warmly welcomed. . . . Michael Sonenscher's scholarly Introduction is devoted to a discussion of different aspects of Sieyes' political ideas, rather than to a detailed examination of the texts themselves. He concentrates mainly, and quite properly, on Sieyes' concept of representation, which he analyses with sensitivity, linking it to Sieyes' concept of the nation, and distinguishing it carefully from the conventional view of representation held by the man in the street. . . . Sonenscher has researched widely and his allusions are original and stimulating. . . . [He] has done a good service in making these compelling and subversive writings more widely available. --Murray Forsyth, <i>History of Political Thought</i></p><br><br><p>This is an invaluable contribution to the study of political thought. Siey�s was the most important political thinker of the French Revolution and one of the great theorists of representative government. Michael Sonenscher has made it easier for Anglophone readers to understand why. In addition to excellent translations, he provides a brilliantly original and illuminating Introduction to these fundamental texts. --Keith Michael Baker, Stanford University</p><br><br><p>Michael Sonenscher's edition of Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes's political writings is, in effect, two substantial works in one. First, Sonenscher provides readers with a sorely needed English-language edition of Sieyes's work that goes beyond the frequently anthologized, but almost inevitably excerpted, 'What is the Third Estate?' With the addition of two contemporaneous pamphlets ('Views of the Executive Means Available to the Representatives of France in 1789' and 'An Essay on Privileges') as well as Sieyes's 1791 debate with Tom Paine, Sonenscher has crafted a scholarly resource that will remain a point of reference for some time. Second, by way of an introduction to this well-translated and annotated edition, Sonenscher offers a lengthy, ambitious essay that, drawing on manuscript sources, gives a fresh and equally overdue perspective on Sieyes's political thought. . . . With this edition of Siey�s's works, Hackett has proven once again that it is much more than a niche publisher of staid and inexpensive classroom editions of the classics in politics and philosophy. As readers of Hackett's editions of Bernard Mandeville (ed. E. J. Hundert), Edmund Burke (ed. J. G. A. Pocock), Niccolo Machiavelli (ed. David Wootton) and Charles-Louis Montesquieu (ed. Melvin Richter)--to name just a few--already know, Hackett is no country cousin to the higher profile series, Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, but is also reshaping and reinvigorating the discipline of the history of political thought. Sonenscher's edition of Siey�s's political writings is no exception. --Paul Cheney, University of Chicago, for <i>H-France Review</i></p></p><h2>The Economics of Attention: Style and Substance in the Age of Information</h2><p><p>If economics is about the allocation of resources, then what is the most precious resource in our new information economy? Certainly not information, for we are drowning in it. No, what we are short of is the attention to make sense of that information. <br> <br> With all the verve and erudition that have established his earlier books as classics, Richard A. Lanham here traces our epochal move from an economy of things and objects to an economy of attention. According to Lanham, the central commodity in our new age of information is not stuff but <i>style</i>, for style is what competes for our attention amidst the din and deluge of new media. In such a world, intellectual property will become more central to the economy than real property, while the arts and letters will grow to be more crucial than engineering, the physical sciences, and indeed economics as conventionally practiced. For Lanham, the arts and letters are the disciplines that study how human attention is allocated and how cultural capital is created and traded. In an economy of attention, style and substance change places. The new attention economy, therefore, will anoint a new set of moguls in the business world&#x2014;not the CEOs or fund managers of yesteryear, but new masters of attention with a grounding in the humanities and liberal arts. <br> <br> Lanham&#x2019;s <i>The Electronic Word</i> was one of the earliest and most influential books on new electronic culture. <i>The Economics of Attention</i> builds on the best insights of that seminal book to map the new frontier that information technologies have created.</p></p><p><b>Richard A. Lanham</b> is professor emeritus of English at the University of California, Los Angeles, and president of Rhetorica, Inc., a consulting and editorial services company. He is the author of numerous books, including<i>The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.It took 2,000 years for punctuation and spaces between words to enter written language, so can the continued evolution of how information is packaged, filtered and consumed be doubted? In this exploration of the changing economics of our information-based world, Lanham, professor emeritus of English at UCLA and author of The Electronic Word, proposes the problem with the information economy is "information doesn't seem in short supply. Precisely the opposite. We're drowning in it." Lanham posits that as society moves from a world defined by "stuff" to one defined by "fluff," people are increasingly in need of filters to weed through the information glut. Enter the arts and letters. Citing sources from the art world to Madison Avenue, Lanham delves into the increasing amount of importance placed on a product's packaging rather than the product itself. Lanham's points are strong and well-researched, as shown through his "background conversations," substitutes for endnotes included at the end of every chapter. If style is going to increasingly operate as the decision-making arbiter, Lanham should be commended on his: clear, jargon-free and forward-thinking. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It has also been widely used in history courses and by general readers. An accessible overview of medical history, this new edition is greatly expanded, including more information on medicine in the United States, Great Britain, and in other European countries. The book continues to be organized conceptually around the major fields of medical endeavor such as anatomy, pharmacology, obstetrics, and psychiatry and has grown to include a new chapter on public health.</p><p>Years of pedagogic experience, medical developments, and reader feedback have led to new sections throughout the book on topics including bioethics, forensics, genetics, reproductive technology, clinical trials, and recent outbreaks of BSE, West Nile Virus, SARS, and anthrax.

(Susan E. Lederer, <em>Canadian Bulletin of Medical History</em>)<br><br>The book is despite its scope, rather related to the Anglo-American medicine.

Combining foundational essays with influential new writings, this collection provides a tool box for understanding old and new media as objects of critical inquiry. It is comprised of over 40 readings that are organized into seven sections representing key concepts and themes covered in an introductory media studies course: culture, technology, representation, industry, identity, audience and citizenship. Critical introductions frame each section to help students place each reading in context and within a broader scholarly dialogue. Rather than relegating the issue of difference to just one section, each section includes scholarship that foregrounds the politics of gender, ethnicity, race, class, sexuality, and geopolitics. Longer readings were selectively edited for conciseness and accessibility, and to maximize breath of coverage. A map of a rapidly growing---and changing---field, <em>The Media Studies Reader</em> is an invaluable resource to students as well as established scholars.</p></p><p><p><strong>Laurie Ouellette</strong> is Associate Professor in Communication Studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, where she teaches Critical Media Studies.&nbsp; She is also affiliated with the American Studies Department and the Graduate Minor in Moving Image Studies. </p><p>"A one-stop shop, this superb collection is chock-full of seminal essays.

Are persons real? Is time real? This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> discusses what, if anything, is "real" by looking at a variety of arguments from philosophy, physics, and cognitive science. Jan Westerhoff shows that the question "what is real?" is not some esoteric puzzle that only philosophers ponder. Scientists also ask this question when they investigate whether candidates for the fundamental constituents of matter are actually "out there" or just a mere abstraction from a successful theory and cognitive scientists ask it when trying to find out which set of the bewildering array of data processed by our brain could constitute the basis for the self.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jan Westerhoff</strong> is Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Durham.<br></p><h2>Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers (Richard Rorty: Philosophical Papers Set 4 Paperbacks) (Volume 3)</h2><p>This eagerly awaited book complements two highly successful previously published volumes of Richard Rorty&#39;s philosophical papers: Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth, and Essays on Heidegger and Others. In this new, provocative collection, Rorty continues to defend a pragmatist view of truth and deny that truth is a goal of inquiry. In these dynamic essays, Rorty also engages with the work of many of today&#39;s most innovative thinkers including Robert Brandom, Donald Davidson, Daniel Dennett, Jacques Derrida, J�rgen Habermas, John McDowell, Hilary Putnam, John Searle, and Charles Taylor. The collection also touches on problems in contemporary feminism raised by Annette Baier, Marilyn Frye, and Catherine MacKinnon, and considers issues connected with human rights and cultural differences. Challenging, stimulating and controversial, this book will appeal to thoughtful readers around the world. Richard Rorty was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, completed his graduate work at Yale, and taught at Princeton from 1961 until 1982. His first ground-breaking book, an attack on traditional epistemology, was Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979). His previous books with Cambridge have been Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989), a book that sold over 46,000 copies since publication and has been translated into seventeen different languages, and two volumes of philosophical papers: Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth, and Essays on Heidegger and Others. A recipient of a MacArthur Foundation grant, Rorty has lectured throughout the world. Also available Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers: Volume 1 0-521-35877-9 Paperback Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers: Volume 2 0-521-35878-7 Paperback</p><p>The philosopher's task, Richard Rorty writes, is "to clear the road for prophets and poets, to make intellectual life a bit simpler and safer for those who have visions of new communities." The essays collected in <i>Truth and Progress</i> show that Rorty is more than up to the challenge. His pragmatic approach is as well suited to brokering peace between "coworkers" Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida as it is to addressing more violent disputes. As Rorty sees it, part of the reason feminism has not been entirely successful in achieving its goals, or ethnic conflicts still rage around the globe, is that we still cling to the notion of an inherent human nature. "Plato set things up," he explains, "so that moral philosophers think they have failed unless they convince the rational egotist that he should not be an egotist--convince him by telling him about his true, unfortunately neglected self. But the rational egotist is not the problem. The problem is the gallant and honorable Serb who sees Muslims as circumcised dogs. It is the brave soldier and good comrade who loves and is loved by his mates, but who thinks of women as dangerous, malevolent whores and bitches."<p> Instead of trying to answer the question, "What is human nature?" Rorty proposes that we ask ourselves what we would like human nature to be, then make every possible effort to be that. In doing so, he does not reject previous philosophic inquiry, although he believes that philosophers must be willing to admit, as scientists do, when their predecessors got things wrong. If inquiry is the continual grappling with and resolution of problems, rather than a quest for "truth," the lessons learned from the past become invaluable tools to apply to new problems as they emerge. Many people disagree with Rorty's conclusions, but they all seem to agree that he has liberated philosophy from detached contemplation of "the real" and reconnected it to the world we live in. <i>Truth and Progress</i> does what all good philosophy should do: it makes you think. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>The volume complements two highly successful previously published volumes of Richard Rorty&#39;s philosophical papers: Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth, and Essays on Heidegger and Others.

Because he uses standard vocabulary and uncomplicated syntax, Sallust is an accessible author at this level. Unlike other Roman historians whose subject matter was a distant past, Sallust writes about events that occurred in his lifetime. His roller-coaster career afforded him a unique opportunity to critique the inner mechanisms of contemporary Roman politics from the vantage of an outsider. <p> Complete with introduction, text, commentary, vocabulary, and bibliography, this volume contains selections (556 lines) from the Bellum Catilinae, the Bellum Iugurthinum, and the Historiae. Selections include character sketches, conspiracy and its betrayal, ethnography, a political speech, and a description of a lavish banquet. Students are prepared for an eventual reading of the monographs in their entirety and become acquainted with the fragmentary Historiae. This reader teaches the rudiments of Latin prose by reinforcing transferable skills that can be applied to other prose authors. While attention is given to Sallusts distinctive style, emphasis is placed on general structures so that students achieve comprehension and appreciation of Latin prose as a distinct-and majestic-art form in its own right. </p><p> Special Features </p><p> * Introduction to Sallusts life, work, and style<br> * Latin text selections (556 lines) from Sallusts Bellum Catilinae (232 lines: 3.3-4.2; 4.3-5.8, 15; 22-25; 27.2-29; 40-41; 53-54), the Bellum Iugurthinum (304 lines: 6-7; 17-19; 84-86), and Historiae (20 lines: 2.70)<br> * Grammatical and historical commentary printed at the back of the book </p><p>For over 30 years Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers has produced the highest quality Latin and ancient Greek books.

Pagan's <i>A Sallust Reader: Selections from Bellum Catilinae, Bellum Iugurthinum, and Historiae</i>. The comedic playwright Plautus and the Roman historian Sallust are significant in studying the culture and history of Rome and serve as ideal sources in the study of Latin for modem students. Enhanced with grammatical and historical notes, maps and photos, and vocabulary, both <i>A Plautus Reader</i> and <i>A Sallust Reader</i> will prove invaluable additions to personal, professional, and academic library Latin Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists. --James A. Cox, Editor-in-Chief Midwest Book Review, Wisconsin Bookwatch: February 2010<br><br>GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES Bolchazy-Carducci has recently commenced launching the first titles in its Latin Reader series, a new collection of innovative high intermediate and advanced Latin readers, specifically designed for college-level study. Under the expert guidance of series editor Ronnie Ancona, Professor of Classics at Hunter College and The Graduate Center, City University of New York, these small, duodecimo-sized paperbacks are intended to introduce authors and genres to students in upper division undergraduate courses. Written by recognized experts, each book will include approximately 500-600 lines of authentic Latin text, accompanied by a thorough introduction, bibliography of suggested reading, annotated commentary, and full vocabulary. There are currently two volumes available, <i>A Lucan Reader: Selections from Civil War</i> (ISBN 978-0865166615) by Susanna Braund and <i>A Terence Reader: Selections from Six Plays</i> (978-0865166783) by William S. Anderson. According to the Bolchazy website, seventeen additional volumes are currently scheduled to be issued. Upcoming authors include Plautus, Sallust, Cicero, Sueconius, Tacitus, Vergil, Caesar, Martial, Apuleius, and Livy. Topics to be covered include Roman Women, Roman Verse Satire, Latin Epic, and Roman Army. Additional authors and themes are under consideration. The inaugural volume, <i>A Lucan Reader</i>, is an introduction to the Silver Age epic poem (often referred to as Pharsalia) retelling the events of the Civil War between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Rarely studied by third and fourth-year college Latin students, this reader provides the opportunity for advanced undergraduates to sample some difficult but fascinating Latin. Following a detailed and compelling introduction, Braund has selected high interest passages: the causes of the Civil War, Caesar at the Rubicon, the abandonment of Rome, the necromancy of Erichtho, Pompey's visitation by Julia's ghost, and Caesar in Troy. I have never read Lucan, but now find myself intrigued. The second volume, <i>A Terence Reader</i>, released just this summer, is an introduction to Roman Comedy. Following a consistent format, Anderson's introduction provides essential background for students and a brief history of Roman Comedy. He then proceeds to explain what made Terence's plays unique, original and thought-provoking. Selections in this volume include excerpts from Andria, Heauton, Phormia, Hecyra, Eunuchus, and Adelphoe, followed by commentary to put the passages in context and provide grammatical assistance. There is also a helpful appendix, with information regarding comic meters. Fans of comedy will be happy to know that the next volume in the series, to be released later this year, will be <i>A Plautus Reader: Selections from Eleven Plays</i> (ISBN 978- 0-86516-694-2) by John Henderson. Given the size of these short readers, teachers and professors should find them useful when customizing a course. Professor Ancona notes that they are ideal for use in combination. I observe that they are inexpensive ($19.95) compared to many college textbooks. Instructors can feel free to mix and match authors and themes to suit their curriculum without causing too much damage to their students' bank accounts. Motivated readers of Latin can sample new authors and themes with expert guidance. Secondary school teachers may even wish to challenge their skilled Advanced Placement students after completing the exam, using some of these selections as a follow-up to the anticipated Caesar/Vergil syllabus. --Sharon Kazmierski, The Classical Outlook, June 1, 2009</p><h2>On Symbols and Society (Heritage of Sociology Series)</h2><p><p>Kenneth Burke's innovative use of dramatism and dialectical method have made him a powerful critical force in an extraordinary variety of disciplines&#x2014;education, philosophy, history, psychology, religion, and others. While most widely acclaimed as a literary critic, Burke has elaborated a perspective toward the study of behavior and society that holds immense significance and rich insights for sociologists. This original anthology brings together for the first time Burke's key writings on symbols and social relations to offer social scientists access to Burke's thought.<br> <br> In his superb introductory essay, Joseph R. Gusfield traces the development of Burke's approach to human action and its relationship to other similar sources of theory and ideas in sociology; he discusses both Burke's influence on sociologists and the limits of his perspective. Burke regards literature as a form of human behavior&#x2014;and human behavior as embedded in language. His lifework represents a profound attempt to understand the implications for human behavior based on the fact that humans are "symbol-using animals." As this volume demonstrates, the work that Burke produced from the 1930s through the 1960s stands as both precursor and contemporary key to recent intellectual movements such as structuralism, symbolic anthropology, phenomenological and interpretive sociology, critical theory, and the renaissance of symbolic interaction.</p></p><p><p>Joseph R.

Moore brings to light the family life of a group that has been largely invisible&#x2015;gay women of color&#x2015;in a book that challenges long-standing ideas about racial identity, family formation, and motherhood. Drawing from interviews and surveys of one hundred black gay women in New York City, <i>Invisible Families </i>explores the ways that race and class have influenced how these women understand their sexual orientation, find partners, and form families. In particular, the study looks at the ways in which the past experiences of women who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s shape their thinking, and have structured their lives in communities that are not always accepting of their openly gay status. Overturning generalizations about lesbian families derived largely from research focused on white, middle-class feminists, <i>Invisible Families</i> reveals experiences within black American and Caribbean communities as it asks how people with multiple stigmatized identities imagine and construct an individual and collective sense of self.</p><p>"Mignon Moore&#x2019;s title says it all: Invisible Families. Scholarship on lesbian and gay issues has been slow to recognize the importance of children and family among those in same-sex relationships and has paid scant attention to racial minorities; nor have students of African American life given much attention to Black lesbians and gay men. We are left with the unfortunate impression, to paraphrase the authors of <i>But Some of Us Are Brave,</i> that all the lesbians and gays are White and all the Blacks are heterosexual. This book stands as a significant corrective to these multiple myopias, offering a nuanced account of the kinds of pressures Black women raising children with female partners encounter, and revealing the creativity and resilience they bring to the struggle." --Ellen Lewin, University of Iowa, author of <i>Gay Fatherhood: Narratives of Family and Citizenship in America.</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible Families</i> shakes up longstanding theoretical conceptualizations of racial identity, family formation, and motherhood, contesting basic assumptions about black families.

Phrases like 'paying attention' and 'investing one's attention' attest to our mistaken belief that attention can be conceptualized in narrow economic terms. We are constantly drawn towards attempts to quantify and commodify attention, even down to counting the number of 'likes' a picture receives on Facebook or a video on YouTube. By contrast, Citton argues that we should conceptualize attention as a kind of ecology and examine how the many different environments to which we are exposed &#x2013; from advertising to literature, search engines to performance art &#x2013; condition our attention in different ways. <br><br> In a world where the demands on our attention are ever-increasing, this timely and original book will be of great interest to students and scholars in media and communications and in literary and cultural studies, and to anyone concerned about the long-term consequences of the profusion of images as well as digital content in the age of the internet. </p></p><p><b>Yves Citton</b> is Professor of French literature at the University of Grenoble."Within the growing field of attention studies, Yves Citton's new book is a superb and indispensable intervention. He provides a devastating analysis of the neoliberal attention economy and opens up crucial pathways for resisting its imperatives."<br><b> Jonathan Crary, Columbia University<br><br></b> "Citton offers a valuable critique and alternative to talk about an &#x201c;economy of attention&#x201d;. He shows how attention produces the individual who is usually presupposed as &#x201c;paying&#x201d; it, and he shows how the creation of attentiveness may not really be an economy at all.

In this book, students will begin their journey with a tour of the brain's fundamental building blocks (neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neurophysiology, neurodevelopment) before moving to mental health challenges and illnesses (Traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's Disease, Addiction, Schizophrenia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Depression). The final section of the book includes chapters addressing topics thought to be important for building resilience against the emergence of mental illness; these chapters cover the topics of adaptive coping strategies, hunger regulation, and the nexus between mental and immune functions. Throughout the text, the value of empirical evidence is emphasized so that meaningful progress can be made toward the identification of the most effective treatment strategies. By understanding multiple neurobiological perspectives such as neuroanatomical, behavioral, evolutionary, and neurochemical approaches currently existing in the field, students will be better prepared to conceptualize the relevant components of these mental health puzzles. Features such as opening chapter vignettes (Connections), case studies (A Case in Point) and feature boxes (Brain Matters) illuminate the course content for students as they learn about the value of translational research.<br><br><strong>Instructor's Manual/Test Bank</strong> (9780199737079) to help instructors prepare for their lectures and homework assignments, with learning objectives, class activities and demonstrations, exercises, additional readings, and more.

Yet the great majority of fatalities from arsenic in the nineteenth century came not from intentional poisoning, but from accident. <br><br>Kept in many homes for the purpose of poisoning rats, the white powder was easily mistaken for sugar or flour and often incorporated into the family dinner. It was also widely present in green dyes, used to tint everything from candles and candies to curtains, wallpaper, and clothing (it was arsenic in old lace that was the danger). Whether at home amidst arsenical curtains and wallpapers, at work manufacturing these products, or at play swirling about the papered, curtained ballroom in arsenical gowns and gloves, no one was beyond the poison's reach. <br><br>Drawing on the medical, legal, and popular literature of the time, <em>The Arsenic Century</em> paints a vivid picture of its wide-ranging and insidious presence in Victorian daily life, weaving together the history of its emergence as a nearly inescapable household hazard with the sordid story of its frequent employment as a tool of murder and suicide. And ultimately, as the final chapter suggests, arsenic in Victorian Britain was very much the pilot episode for a series of environmental poisoning dramas that grew ever more common during the twentieth century and still has no end in sight.<br></p><p><br>James C.

The narrative is a complex mix of quotation and the author s own words, which creates the feel of a Victorian melodrama. It is well researched and finely detailed with the history of legislative controls, medical advances, and the development of medical jurisprudence all successfully interwoven throughout the narrative.

This book provides a definitive view of these revivals, now known as the First Great Awakening, and their dramatic effects on American culture. Historian Thomas S. Kidd tells the absorbing story of early American evangelical Christianity through the lives of seminal figures like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield as well as many previously unknown preachers, prophets, and penitents. The Great Awakening helped create the evangelical movement, which heavily emphasized the individual&#x2019;s experience of salvation and the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s work in revivals. By giving many evangelicals radical notions of the spiritual equality of all people, the revivals helped breed the democratic style that would come to characterize the American republic. Kidd carefully separates the positions of moderate supporters of the revivals from those of radical supporters, and he delineates the objections of those who completely deplored the revivals and their wildly egalitarian consequences. The battles among these three camps, the author shows, transformed colonial America and ultimately defined the nature of the evangelical movement.</p></p><p><p>Thomas S.

Now, in this well-documented and provocative volume, historian Robert Gellately argues that the majority of German citizens had quite a clear picture of the extent of Nazi atrocities, and continued to support the Reich to the bitter end. <br> Culling chilling evidence from primary news sources and citing dozens of case studies, Gellately shows how media reports and press stories were an essential dimension of Hitler's popular dictatorship. Indeed, a vast array of material on the concentration camps, the violent campaigns against social outsiders, and the Nazis' radical approaches to "law and order" was published in the media of the day, and was widely read by a highly literate population of Germans. Hitler, Gellately reveals, did not try to hide the existence of the Gestapo or of concentration camps. Nor did the Nazis try to cow the people into submission. Instead they set out to win converts by building on popular images, cherished ideals, and long-held phobias. And their efforts succeeded, Gellately concludes, for the Gestapo's monstrous success was due, in large part, to ordinary German citizens who singled out suspected "enemies" in their midst, reporting their suspicions and allegations freely and in a spirit of cooperation and patriotism.<br> Extensively documented, highly readable and illustrated with never-before-published photographs, <em>Backing Hitler</em> convincingly debunks the myth that Nazi atrocities were carried out in secret. From the rise of the Third Reich well into the final, desperate months of the war, the destruction of innocent lives was inextricably linked to the will of the German people.</p><p><br><strong>Robert Gellately</strong> is the Strassler Professor in Holocaust History at Clark University, and is the author of <em>The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy 1933-1945</em>. He lives in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.<br>Using newspapers and radio broadcasts of the day as evidence, Gellately (The Gestapo and German Society), Strassler Professor in Holocaust History at Clark University, effectively demonstrates how "ordinary Germans" evolved into a powerful base of support for the Nazi regime. Although Hitler and the National Socialists had never garnered an outright majority in elections before 1933, the author convincingly shows that "the great majority of the German people soon became devoted to Hitler and they supported him to the bitter end in 1945." The Nazis achieved this political miracle by "consensus." The Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci argued that political regimes could hardly expect to use unlimited terror against their subjects a technique combining the threat of terror and coercion would be more effective. Using Gramscian theory is hardly new in an analysis of Nazi Germany, but Gellately does make a provocative claim: that the Nazi use of terror against certain categories of "undesirables" (first Communists, Socialists and trade unionists, then Catholic and Protestant opponents, then the mentally and/or physically impaired, then the Jews and Gypsies) was purposively public and that most Germans agreed with such policies. Decrees, legislation, police actions and the concentration camps were not meant to be hidden from the German people, but in fact were extensively publicized. Some of the same arguments have been made in Adam Lebor and Roger Boyes's Seduced by Hitler (Forecasts, Mar. 26), but readers will notice that Gellately offers a far more sophisticated argument and more abundant evidence than Daniel Goldhagen's cause c&#x201a;l&#x160;bre, Hitler's Willing Executioners. In truth, Gellately's work is what Goldhagen's book could have been, but wasn't; that is, a closely reasoned and tightly constructed analysis. 42 illus. not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Auditing and Assurance Services with ACL Software CD (15th Edition)</h2><p><p>Directed primarily toward Accounting college/university majors, this text also provides practical content to current and aspiring industry professionals.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <i>Auditing and Assurance Services: An Integrated Approach</i> presents an integrated concepts approach that shows readers the auditing process from start to finish.

There is even a danger that some classic articles will cease to be known because they are no longer included in &#34;issue of the moment&#34; anthologies. This book offers classic, well-written articles that have stood the test of time and have something to teach. These are articles with good philosophical analysis dealing with important topics and making significant contributions to understanding of issues. There are no long, boring selections from government commissions or technical pieces from scientific journals. Many selections illustrate how and why philosophers contributed to the progress of medical ethics. The articles cluster around several broad philosophical questions: terminating the lives of dying patients; assisting human life to begin outside the womb; terminating the beginnings of human life; personhood and higher animals, fetuses, impaired newborns, comatose patients; individual rights against the greater social good; and allocating scarce medical resources.</p><p>Gregory Pence is one of the pioneering bioethicists of America. Having taught for thirty years in a medical school, he has seen many past prophecies of doom fail. He is optimistic about biotechnology.<p> He is internationally famous for defending cloning and genetically modified food against bioLuddites who oppose research on stem cells and cloning. Because of his views, his talks have been picketed by Greenpeace and anti-cloning zealots.</p><p> His Classic Cases in Medical Ethics: Accounts of the Cases that Shaped Medical Ethics, 4th ed., 2003, is one of the standard textbooks of bioethics. His Who's Afraid of Human Cloning? (1998) is already regarded as a classic in bioethics for its rigorous attack on opponents of cloning. His Cloning After Dolly: Who's STILL Afraid of Human Cloning? will appear in late 2004. His Designer Food: Mutant Harvest or Breadbasket of the World? won a Choice Outstanding Academic Title in 2003.</p><p> He doesn't think the sky will fall if a cloned baby is born. In opposing laws against cloning, he was asked to testify in 2001 before Congress and in 2002 before the California Senate.</p><p> Constantly in demand for national television, Pence has been interviewed on Bobby Battista's "Talk Back Live" with Bobby Battista, "The Point" with Gretta von Susteren on CNN, "The Early Show with Bryant Gumbel" on CBS, "Wolf Blitzer's Washington" on CNN, as well as on National Public Radio's "Marketplace" and its "Weekend Edition."

This groundbreaking study examines the family in the context of the colony founded by the Pilgrims who came over on the <em>Mayflower</em>. Basing his work on physical artifacts, wills, estate inventories, and a variety of legal and official enactments, Demos portrays the family as a structure of roles and relationships, emphasizing those of husband and wife, parent and child, and master and servant. The book's most startling insights come from a reconsideration of commonly-held views of American Puritans and of the ways in which they dealt with one another. Demos concludes that Puritan "repression" was not as strongly directed against sexuality as against the expression of hostile and aggressive impulses, and he shows how this pattern reflected prevalent modes of family life and child-rearing. The result is an in-depth study of the ordinary life of a colonial community, located in the broader environment of seventeenth-century America.<br>Demos has provided a new foreword and a list of further reading for this second edition, which will offer a new generation of readers access to this classic study.</p><p>The customary modern image of the New England Puritans is a dark one: the Puritans, religious dissenters who valued propriety and order, are seen as a witch-hunting, suspicious tribe, and their very name carries connotations of grimness and primness.<p> Thirty years ago, at the outset of his career as a historian, John Demos decided to reexamine that view in light of the evidence. Among the findings that he reports in <i>A Little Commonwealth</i> is the surprising discovery that the Puritans were not so, well, puritanical. They were not, Demos argues, especially consumed by ideology, and in their daily lives, "religion seems to figure in a somewhat haphazard and occasional way." The Puritans, he continues, had no unusual objections to sexuality or fun-seeking, except where such activities endangered social harmony--and the Puritans were indeed fiercely protective of group stability. Demos examines such documents as the transcripts of divorce proceedings to suggest that Puritan women enjoyed, if not equal rights, then better consideration than most women in other English colonies in the New World. He looks closely into the material culture of the Puritans, which shows some odd discrepancies: for instance, although few households possessed more than a single chair (usually reserved for the elderly), many contained elaborate wardrobes--for, Demos writes, "clothing was not only a good investment for a man of some means; it was also a way of demonstrating his standing in the larger community and of confirming his own self-image."</p><p> In questioning the view of the Puritans as a plain-dressing, plain-living, haunted, and repressed sect, Demos provides a close and intriguing look at the New England past. Reissued on the 30th anniversary of its first publication, <i>A Little Commonwealth</i> deserves a wide audience today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>John Demos</strong> is Samuel Knight Professor of History at Yale University.

In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Pioneering schizophrenia treatment developer William R. McFarlane first lays out the theoretical and empirical foundations of the multifamily model. Chapters coauthored with other leading clinician-researchers then provide detailed "how-to" instructions for forming groups; implementing educational and problem-solving interventions; managing clinical, relationship, and functional issues that may arise; and integrating psychoeducation with other forms of treatment. Also addressed are applications of the model--some described here for the first time--to a variety of disorders other than schizophrenia, including bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and medical illness.<br></p><p>William R. McFarlane, MD, is Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont and Director of Research and former Chairman, Department of Psychiatry, Maine Medical Center.

Indeed, without writers and artists, medical experts in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries would not have had much of the material on which they based their theories of sexual perversions. Thus it was that Rene Descartes could be diagnosed as a fetishist, because of his inordinate attraction to cross-eyed women, Gustave Flaubert as a hysteric, because of his hypersensitive imagination, and Emile Zola ("the novelist of the quivering nostrils") as an epileptoid degenerate, olfactory fetishist, and sexual psychopath, because of the suspicious richness of odors emanating from the pages of his books.<br> Drawing upon the writings of literary figures such as Diderot, Rousseau, Zola, Flaubert, and Huysmans, and physicians and psychologists such as Tardieu, Binet, and Charcot, Vernon Rosario argues that the modern idea of the perverse first emerged in late 18th-century France and was shaped largely by the strange confluence of medical writings, patient confessions, and literary narratives. Beginning with the shocking revelations of masturbation and masochism in Rousseau's <em>Confessions</em>, and the widespread public alarm over the "fatal convenience" of the "solitary vice," <em>The Erotic</em> <em>Imagination</em> illuminates precisely how various forms of eroticism came to be classified as perversions. Rosario takes the reader through a dizzying proliferation of "pathologies"--including the bizarre theories which enabled doctors to identify homosexuals, or "inverts," according to bodily stigmata, to the "uterine fury" of nymphomania, to an astonishing range of hysterias, fetishes, and erotomanias until finally only marital, reproductive sex survived as normal. Such "perversification" of sexual desire attempted to close off and regulate those erotic expressions seen as threatening to the social order, national population, military power, and the supremacy of will and reason. In each case, Rosario argues, the original culprit of deviant behavior was identified as the imagination--a perilous site beyond surveillance, highly susceptible to the salacious effects of literature, where irrational associations might take root and usurp the "reality" of conventional sexuality. What emerges most compellingly from Rosario's study is the anxiety produced by the erotic imagination and the elaborate, often desperate theoretical fabrications designed to contain it.<br> Filled with extraordinary case studies and written in prose that is as lively and entertaining as it is insightful, this book offers both a history of the erotic imagination and its narrative expressions, as well as a fascinating mirror in which our contemporary ambivalence about sexuality--from the acrimonious rhetoric of family values to censorship of pornography and hostility towards gays--takes on surprising new significance.</p><p><br>Vernon A. Rosario II is Andrew W. Mellon Fellow, Department of the History and Sociology of Science, University of Pennsylvania. He is the coeditor of <em>Solitary Pleasures: The Historical, Literary and Artistic Discourses of Auto-Eroticism</em> and editor of <em>Science and Homosexualites</em><br><br>"Rosario's historical study of the erotic imagination in France illuminates brilliantly the crucial role that sexual confessions have played in first identifying eroticism and then linking it decisively to perverse sexuality. In their respective ways, as he wittily demonstrates, both medical experts and their patients have channeled into eroticism the anxieties and obsessions of modern society."--Robert A. Nye<p></p><br>Dr. Rosario's fascinating study of the developments of society's concepts of perversity is especially enriched by his unusual background. His thorough knowledge of the history of science, and expertise in medicine are combined with an ability to analyze both literary and medical texts in an extremely subtle manner. his impressive command of the French literary tradition as well as recent theoretical frameworks gives him work authority and complexity. The writing throughout is illuminating, elegant, and richly satisfying."--Henry F.

He died at Gads Hill, his home in Kent, on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children in a family often plagued by debt, Dickens at ten saw his father arrested and confined in the Marshalsea, a debtors&#x2019; prison in London, and although a small boy he was placed in a blacking factory where he worked at labeling bottles, visiting John Dickens on Sundays. Charles returned to school on his father&#x2019;s release, taught himself shorthand, and at sixteen became a parliamentary reporter. At twenty-four his career took off with the publication of <i>Sketches by Boz</i> (1836), which was followed by <i>Pickwick Papers</i> the next year. As a novelist and magazine editor he had a long run of serialized successes through <i>Our Mutual Friend </i>(1864-65). His family life had ended earlier, in 1858, when fame drew him apart from his wife of twenty-three years, Catherine, and (although his readers never knew) into the arms of young Ellen Ternan, an actress.

The initiatory path this opens, one the author compares to the Royal Way of Alchemy, transforms the novice not only mentally but also physically, altering even the very fluids of his or her body. For Kremmerz, magic is the supreme science, the highest expression of what exists and what is possible. <br><br>With this book, first published in Italian in 1897 and available here for the first time in English, Kremmerz sought to redefine magical initiation as well as other key components of the occult sciences. His aim was to bring the hermetic path of initiation back into alignment with the strict procedures and symbolism that defined the spiritual practices of Pythagoras and the heirs to his tradition. He visualized the initiate as a disciple who has escaped the stagnant water in which the rest of humanity is immersed and entered a state of non-ordinary consciousness, one that allows for the successful pursuit of realization and contact with the magical will. <br><br>In this transformative initiatory guide, Kremmerz details the occult purification and preparation the path of natural and divine magic requires. The spiritual course advocated by Kremmerz is arduous--to move forward on the path of true realization, one that will allow the initiate to &#x201c;climb to heaven&#x201d; while still alive, the aspirant must commit to total severance from everyday life. Yet Kremmerz&#x2019;s words themselves serve to trigger the beginning of transformation within us, making the very act of reading this primer the first step on the path of initiation into the hermetic science.</p><p>Giuliano M. Kremmerz (1861-1930), also known as J. M. Kremm-Erz and born as Ciro Formisano, was an Italian alchemist, hermeticist, philosopher, and prominent member of the Ur Group, alongside Julius Evola. He was initiated into the mysteries of the Sacred Science by Pasquale De Servis, known as Izar, and published writings on natural and divine magic through the journal Il Mondo Secreto. In 1896 he founded the Schola Philosophica Hermetica Classica Italica and its associated body Fratellanza Terapeutica Magica di Miriam (Therapeutic and Magic Brotherhood of Miriam), a school and group still in operation in Italy today.<b>Part One: Introduction to the Science of the Occult <br><br>Science Is For Those Who Conquer <br></b><br>It In order to understand well and clearly all that has been written on the occult sciences, magic, and so on, one must understand what lies at the basis of the theory and practice of magic. <br><br>In magic the concept of the universe is the synthesis of all that exists. All that exists is a unity, a synthesis of three essential elements, matter, life and energy. <br><br>The great synthesis is completely analogical in its parts.<br><br> If you go up a mountain where no blade of grass can be found, and no birds sing, do you think you are alone? You, the stones, the air you breathe, the stars above, are all one in one universe. Broaden your own human reason to fuse it with the world&#x2019;s reason and you will acquire the sense of the world&#x2019;s reason. Your soul is the soul of the world. <br><br>From this notion astrology was born: the word (or logos) of the stars.<br><br> Ermes says in his <i>Smaragdine Tablet</i> that all that is above is like all that is below, and to know this is enough to work the miracle of one thing.<br><br> Study man and you will know the universe, study the universe and you will know man; from the universe come down to man; apply to him the laws of the universe; from man you go up to the universe and you discover the occult laws there. Man has a soul, thought, a direction, a purpose: so does the universe. The universe has motion, breath, evolution, renewal: so does man. Everything is analogical and the magical process par excellence is analogy. Even the sacred symbol which attempts are made to explain through likenesses is analogical; so too is the law of miracles of magic procedures and the study of analogy leads to the knowledge of magic or the wisdom of Solomon. <br><br>The vital stream is a single one. <br><br>The process of evolution and involution of action in universal life is a constant one.<br><br> This force or vital stream transforms itself according to the medium it nourishes and gives life to, and acquires a new form.<br><br> Papus wrote: &#x201c;Everything is analogical, the law that governs the world also governs the life of an insect. To study the manner in which cells gather to form an organ is to study the way in which the kingdoms of nature gather to form the earth, an organ of our universe; it is the way of studying how men gather to form a family, an organ of mankind. To study the formation of a device through its parts means to learn about the formation of a world from planets and of a nation from planets. Finally to learn the constitution of the universe from the worlds and of mankind from the nations.&#x201d; <br><br>* * *<br> <br>From what I have said, the analogical concept of all that is transformation in the life of the universe becomes clear. Let us now pass on to man, who interests us particularly. For some, man is matter, for others (theologists) he is matter and spirit for the science of magicians he is the reflection of the life of the universe and therefore tri-partite in his formation. Body, astral body, and soul. The astral body can consciously go outside the body, as with adepts, or perfect initiates (magicians), or unconsciously and consequently undergoing the chance influences of the moment (wandering spirits), as in any medium. <br><br>When the body breaks into pieces or shatters, the astral body takes flight and man dies. If one man imposes his astral body on that of another, he magnetizes him. <br><br>Official science admits that in man there is a force, (hypnotic, psychic, ectenic), but does not determine or accept that this force is constantly in play under an intelligence outside the active operating subject. In the evidence the potential of this force is admitted but the mediumism is excluded; that is, the intervention of an intelligent spirit or entity outside the purely physical or natural forces of the operator is denied. Let us then begin not to despise the occult and to admit the existence of a force in man which is at apparent but is capable of increasing his potential, and let us pass from known experiments to much more complex applications which belong to the sphere of secret traditional science--secret for unknown reasons, but which perhaps those who today violently oppose the terrible word would keep if they realized what great effects this force can have when mastered by one who has the true key to it.</p><h2>Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, Vol. 1 (Mind (Hardcover))</h2><p>Proposes a theory of evolution that accounts for the development of human intellect from animal mentality</p><p><p>"Langer has brought to light ideas of astonishing depth, exactness, power and reach...

He is the author of multiple bestsellers and is America's leading inspirational author.Bestselling author Lucado (<i>Come Thirsty</i>) dedicates his latest book to helping readers discover their "sweet spot"&#x2014;the job or life calling they were created for. He guides readers on their search to find the unique abilities God may have built into them. First step: "read your life backward" to see where you've been successful and what you've loved in the past. Readers are directed to find their personal "S.T.O.R.Y."&#x2014;strengths, topic, optimal conditions, relationships and "Yes!" moments. This acronym originates with People Management Inc., whose theories helped Lucado find his own strengths and form much of the foundation for this book. For Lucado, discovering one's life purpose is really about honoring the God who gave the unique abilities in the first place, so he instructs readers not to make decisions based on greed. Instead, he exhorts them to "make a big deal out of God" rather than worrying about their own reputation and to trust God to use their "small beginnings" in his overall purpose. The book contains a "Sweet Spot Discovery Guide" with detailed exercises from People Management to help readers uncover their own personal "S.T.O.R.Y."&#x2014;though some will want further guidance. As always, evangelical readers will appreciate that Lucado is easy to read while still substantive and orthodox, and many struggling to find the work that's right for them will find this book very helpful. <i>(Jan. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Schwartz here examines the visual appeal of such films, and then broadens her analysis to explore their production and distribution, probing the profitable influences that Hollywood and Paris exerted on each other. This exchange moved beyond individual films with the sensational spectacle of the Cannes Film Festival and the meteoric career of Brigitte Bardot. And in turn, their success led to a new kind of film that celebrated internationalism and cultural hybridity. Ultimately, Schwartz uncovers an intriguing paradox: that the road to globalization was paved with nationalist clich�s, and thus, films beloved for being so French were in fact the first signs of a nascent cosmopolitan culture.<br><br>Packed with an array of colorful film stills, publicity photographs, paparazzi shots, ads, and never before seen archival images, <i>It&#x2019;s So French!</i> is an incisive account of the fertile collaboration between France and the United States that expanded the geographic horizons of both filmmaking and filmgoing, forever changing what the world saw and dreamed of when they went to the movies.</p><p><b>Vanessa R. Schwartz</b> lives in Santa Monica and is professor of history, art history, and&nbsp;critical studies at the University of Southern California. She is coeditor of <i>Cinema and the Invention of Modern Life</i>, and the author of <i>Spectacular Realities: Early Mass Culture in Fin-de-Si�cle Paris</i>."Vanessa R. Schwartz's account of Franco-American relations in the world of cinema is an erudite analysis of the dialogue between the two filmic powers. . . .&nbsp;A lively discussion of a rich subject."&#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i> (<i>Financial Times</i> 2008-01-12)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Hers is no sterile school-book approach. . . . Schwartz&#x2019;s well-researched book expertly documents this profound event in the development of cosmopolitan film culture as we know it today. Recommended.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2007-09-15)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is a must-read for anyone interested in movies, the irresistible appeal of things French, or the true history of globalization.&nbsp;Every page sparkles with surprising insights and wonderful stories about classic films, the Cannes film festival, and the making of a global market for cinema.&nbsp;Old Europe turns out to be the partner, not the enemy, of the brash moguls and dreamy-eyed starlets of Hollywood. Schwartz takes readers on her own dazzling tour around the world of making movies and in the process deeply enriches both our sense of cinema&#x2019;s history and its contribution to modern culture.&#x201d;</p> (Lynn Hunt, University of California, Los Angeles, author of Inventing Human Rights and Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution 2007-06-14)<br><br>"Provocative and original. . . . <i>It's So French!</i>, based on impressive scholarship and superbly illustrated, builds a solid case for France's role in the growth of 'cosmopolitan film culture'. The book is a stimulating corrective to entrenched views of Franco-American cinematic relations as necessarily conflictual."&#x2014;<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In a scholarly tour de force, Vanessa Schwartz reveals how a series of Franco-American liaisons created the global film industry. This is one of the most perceptive histories ever written about the making of mass culture&#x2014;and a pleasure to read.&#x201d;</p> (Michael Kazin, Georgetown University, author of A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan and coauthor of America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s 2007-06-14)<br><br><p>&#x201c;It is difficult to say whether Vanessa Schwartz&#x2019;s work provides more brilliant analyses and stimulating perspectives to the history of culture or to the history of the cinema. Undoubtedly to both, since the connections she makes between filmmaking and the creation of urban <i>imaginaires</i> are original and convincing. Neither Hollywood, obviously, nor Paris, as well, would exist without films, at least in our thoughts and desires, and Vanessa Schwartz shows this masterfully. &#x2018;So French!&#x2019;&#x2014;perhaps, but so well done&#x2014;absolutely!&#x201d;</p> (Antoine de Baecque, coauthor of Truffaut: A Biography 2007-06-14)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Original in its argument as well as in its research, <i>It&#x2019;s So French!</i> offers a compelling counterargument to the common claim that cinema was a major component in the Americanization of postwar culture worldwide, including France. Instead, Vanessa Schwartz argues that <i>together</i> French and American film culture played a significant role in globalizing a cosmopolitan culture in the 1950s and early 1960s.&#x201d;</p> (Richard Abel, general editor of Encyclopedia of Early Cinema 2007-09-13)<br><br>"I highly recommend this book to all who love 'Frenchness films' and all who are interested in reading about a time in the history of film when France and America actively collaborated to create films that expanded our geographic consciousness as well as globalized our minds." (Irene Javors <i>Screening the Past</i>)<br><br>"Schwartz's argument is truly remarkable in its scope and its ability to reconceptualize conventional narratives about Americanization, globalization, Franco-American relations, and the history of film. By reframing the relationship between art, commerce, and celebrity . . . she also challenges us to rethink the early Cold War years." (Jeffrey H. Jackson <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Schwartz's book is refreshing and stimulating. . . . The strengths of the book seem to me to lie in its welcome comparative approach, its range of fascinating detail, and its challenge to received wisdom. Schwartz has made an excellent case for film historians to rethink the period, to boldly go beyond their more usual national approach, and to pay more attention to the origins of cosmopolitan/Western filmmaking."

In simple and direct language, Peirce describes the intuitive process as a new way of life and demonstrates practical applications from speeding decision making to expanding personal growth. Whether you&#39;re just beginning to search for a richer, fuller life experience or are looking for more subtle, sophisticated insights about your spiritual path, The Intuitive Way will be your companion as you progress through the stages of intuition development.</p><p>When intuition is in full bloom, life takes on a magical, effortless quality; your world is suddenly full of synchronicities, creative insights, and abundant knowledge. Through an easy-to-understand ten-step course, The Intuitive Way shows you how to enter that state of perceptual aliveness and integrate it into daily life to achieve greater natural flow. Author Penney Peirce synthesizes teachings from psychology, East-West philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and business. In simple and direct language, Peirce describes the intuitive process as a new way of life and demonstrates practical applications from speeding up decision-making to expanding personal growth. Whether you&#39;re just beginning to search for a richer, fuller life experience or are looking for more subtle, sophisticated insights about your spiritual path, The Intuitive Way will be your companion as you progress through the stages of intuition development toward grasping your soul&#39;s purpose.I wrote The Intuitive Way after over 20 years experience working with creativity, metaphysics, psychology and cross-cultural spirituality. I&#39;ve worked in business and as a professional &#34;expert intuitive,&#34; doing thousands of Life Path Readings all over the world. In looking at what&#39;s truly valuable in life, I find that it is knowledge of the deep, inner self, which leads us to an experience of connectedness/communion with the divine and with other forms of life on our planet. Overwhelmingly,we want to know today what our life purpose is, what our real motivation is, what gives us passion. It is only through intuition, or &#34;direct knowing,&#34; that we can discover this certainty. Intuition is both a vehicle for profound spiritual knowledge and for success and enjoyment in our ordinary, daily lives. My book is designed to give you a thorough experience of the sequence of steps one goes through on the journey into intuitive awareness. If you follow the ten chapters and do the exercises, you will develop much greater skill and clarity in your perception. My book is different from many others currently available, in that I deal with the Hero&#39;s Journey into the underworld--as a NATURAL part of the process of intuition development, and give methods for effectively navigating the subconscious mind. I differentiate between the intuitive process and psychism, which I believe is just a small part of intuition. My orientation is practical, friendly, mystical, and I value common sense. As I wrote The Intuitive Way, I had a little sign up next to my computer: &#34;Every paragraph must be compassionate.&#34; I invite you to experience more depth in life by exploring your own wondrous, unknown regions, and by trusting your inner voice and the truth and anxiety signals you get from your body. Intuition is truly a path to an integrated, creative life.</p><h2>Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living</h2><p>A finely honed abridgement of Emerson&#39;s principal essays with an introduction that clarifies the essence of Emerson&#39;s ideas and establishes their relevance to our own troubled era. This is the first truly accessible edition of Emerson&#39;s work, revealing him to be one of America&#39;s wisest teachers.</p><p>"Emerson is someone I always felt I ought to read but each time I sat down to do so, I got overwhelmed after just a few pages and ended up guiltily putting down the book. Then one day Richard Whelan came to me. He had taken Emerson's spiritual essays and pruned them back to their essentials (what's here is about 50% of each essay), making the teaching of each one easily accessible. What a boon! And he had written an introduction setting this practical wisdom in the context of Emerson's life and studies, showing where he had found some of his ideas and how he had developed them. I see this book as a beginner's guide to Emerson. Anyone who falls in love with the clarity of his thought here can go on to read all of Emersons work ."<br> --Toinette Lippe, editorial director of Bell Tower"Emerson is the sweetest singer of our highest moments. For anyone in search of a tonic draft of his wisdom, this book, collecting some of his most radiant moods, is a rapture and an inspiration." <br>--Pico Iyer<br><br>"These selections from Emerson's essays, equally severe and consoling, are remarkably current in their wisdom. They are chosen with great care by Richard Whelan, and offer a special unextinguishable light."<br>-- Roger Rosenblatt</p><h2>American Families: A Multicultural Reader</h2><p><p>In the past forty years, American families have become more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before.

The portrait is of a society not in decay or decline, but, on the contrary, growing up so fast in international predominance and material prosperity, in cosmopolitanism of population and Hellenization of ideas, as finally to tumble over its own feet.

This novel is based on the author&#39;s personal experience as a teacher in Brussels. It is a moving tale of repressed feelings and subjection to cruel circumstance and position, borne with heroic fortitude. It is also the story of a woman&#39;s right to love and be loved.</p><p>With her final novel, <i>Villette</i>, Charlotte Bronte reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte&#39;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.</p><h2>A Minute to Midnight (An Atlee Pine Thriller, 2)</h2><p><b>FBI Agent Atlee Pine returns to her Georgia hometown to investigate her twin sister's abduction, only to encounter a serial killer in this page-turning thriller from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author.</b><b><br></b>FBI Agent Atlee Pine's life was never the same after her twin sister Mercy was kidnapped--and likely killed--thirty years ago. After a lifetime of torturous uncertainty, Atlee's unresolved anger finally gets the better of her on the job, and she finds she has to deal with the demons of her past if she wants to remain with the FBI.<br><br> Atlee and her assistant Carol Blum head back to Atlee's rural hometown in Georgia to see what they can uncover about the traumatic night Mercy was taken and Pine was almost killed. But soon after Atlee begins her investigation, a local woman is found ritualistically murdered, her face covered with a wedding veil--and the first killing is quickly followed by a second bizarre murder.<br><br> Atlee is determined to continue her search for answers, but now she must also set her sights on finding a potential serial killer before another victim is claimed. But in a small town full of secrets--some of which could answer the questions that have plagued Atlee her entire life--digging deeper into the past could be more dangerous than she realizes . . . <br><br></p><p>David Baldacci is a global #1 bestselling author, and one of the world&#39;s favorite storytellers.

At the center of Leibniz&#39;s philosophy stands his metaphysics, an ambitious attempt to discover the nature of reality through the use of unaided reason. This volume provides a systematic and comprehensive account of the full range of Leibniz&#39;s thought, exploring the metaphysics in detail and showing its subtle and complex relationship to his views on logic, language, physics, and theology.</p><p>Observing that Leibniz "could manage simultaneously all the sciences," Bernard de Fontenelle half-seriously proposed that the student of his work should "make several savants from only one Leibniz." Fortunately, the 13 essays contained in <i>The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz</i> ought to make it unnecessary to dissect the great 17th-century polymath. The contributors, all distinguished scholars of Leibniz's work (strangely, though not objectionably per se, also all English speakers), have created a guide suitable for specialists and nonspecialists alike, well worth the attention of anyone interested in Leibniz's philosophy.<p> Roger Ariew's biographical essay and Stuart Brown's essay on the 17th-century intellectual backdrop help to situate Leibniz in his milieu. At the center of the <i>Companion</i>, however, are the essays that deal with Leibniz's metaphysics. His early metaphysical work is discussed by Christina Mercer and R.C. Sleigh Jr., who reveal, surprisingly, that it was ultimately motivated by his ambitious project to reconcile Roman Catholics and Protestants. Donald Rutherford examines Leibniz's later metaphysical work, dominated by the theory of monads, which "posits that the only fully real beings are unextended, soul-like substances." David Blumenfeld explains Leibniz's ontological and cosmological arguments for the existence of God; he also discusses Leibniz's famous dictum--ridiculed by Voltaire in <i>Candide</i>--that this is the best of all possible worlds. Other essays deal with Leibniz's work in logic, the philosophy of language, epistemology, physics, and moral philosophy. The <i>Companion</i> concludes with Catherine Wilson's insightful discussion of the reception of Leibniz's philosophy, although she unfortunately ends her historical survey with Kant. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>This volume provides a systematic and comprehensive account of the full range of Leibniz&#39;s thought, exploring the metaphysics in detail and showing its subtle and complex relationship to his views on logic, language, physics, and theology.</p><h2>Entre mundos: An Integrated Approach for the Native Speaker</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This highly motivating and interactive book presents heritage speakers of Spanish with authentic materials that highlight Hispanic cultures within and beyond the United States. <b>KEY TOPICS</b> Unique in its approach to the development of the four language skills&#x2014;listening, speaking, reading, writing, the book offers learners the opportunity to practice vocabulary and grammar consistently integrated with the content of the readings. <b> </b> For native Spanish speakers as well as advanced non-native learners of the language. </p></p><p>This flexible, activity-based language text builds upon the knowledge and skills that home speakers of Spanish bring to the classroom.

Drawing upon often neglected fragments of history, evidence is presented which indicates that the seeds of democracy were planted one thousand years before the beginning of the Christian Era, suggesting that America is not merely a political and industrial entity, but an &#34;assignment of destiny.&#34;</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Back in print at last, America&#39;s place in the essential progress of civilization is emphasized as the story unfolds of how our continent was set aside for the great experiment of enlightened self-government. Drawing upon often neglected fragments of history, evidence is presented which indicates that the seeds of this plan for the founding of America were planted one thousand years before the beginning of the Christian era. Whether discussing the symbolism of the Great Seal of the U.S.S or the mysterious stranger who swayed the signers of the Declaration of Independence, here is a book sure to fascinate. It shows how the brilliant plan of the ancients, concealed from the common view, has survived to the present day and will continue to function until the great work is accomplished.</p><h2>Sarah Osborn&#39;s World: The Rise of Evangelical Christianity in Early America (New Directions in Narrative History)</h2><p><p><b>A colonial woman's riveting personal journal and correspondence opens a window on America's first-generation evangelicals</b><br><br> In 1743, sitting quietly with pen in hand, Sarah Osborn pondered how to tell the story of her life, how to make sense of both her spiritual awakening and the sudden destitution of her family. Remarkably, the memoir she created that year survives today, as do more than&nbsp;two thousand&nbsp;additional pages she composed over the following three decades. <i>Sarah Osborn's World</i> is the first book to mine this remarkable woman&#x2019;s prolific personal and spiritual record. Catherine Brekus recovers the largely forgotten story of Sarah Osborn's life as one of the most charismatic female religious leaders of her time, while also connecting her captivating story to the rising&nbsp;evangelical movement in eighteenth-century America.</p><p>A schoolteacher in Rhode Island, a wife, and a mother, Sarah Osborn&nbsp;led a remarkable revival in the 1760s that brought hundreds of people, including many slaves, to her house each week. Her extensive written record&#x2014;encompassing issues ranging from the desire to be "born again" to a suspicion of capitalism&#x2014;provides a unique vantage point from which to view the emergence of evangelicalism. Brekus sets Sarah Osborn's experience in the context of her revivalist era and expands our understanding of the birth of the evangelical movement&#x2014;a movement that transformed Protestantism in the decades&nbsp;before the American Revolution.</p></p><p><b>Catherine A. Brekus</b> is Charles Warren Professor of the History of Religion in America at Harvard Divinity School. She lives in Auburndale, MA.&#x201c;This will become the best biography we have on a female evangelical in colonial America, following naturally from Brekus&#x2019;s earlier book on women preachers in early America. But I would also recommend this as simply one of the best books I have read on the life of an American evangelical, female or male, particularly because Brekus is able so successfully to combine historical analysis of evangelicalism with the details of Osborn&#x2019;s life and writings.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Kidd, Baylor University (Thomas Kidd)<br><br><i>Sarah Osborn&#x2019;s World</i> reflects unusually industrious research, profound historical insight, and extraordinary human empathy.&nbsp;It offers a superb depiction of the long and complex life of a woman who was at the heart of eighteenth-century American evangelical history.&nbsp;The remarkable character of that life is matched by the remarkable success of this book."&#x2014;Mark A.

The dominant &#39;Anglo-Saxon&#39; reaction to philosophical development in France has for some decades been one of suspicion, occasionally tempered by curiosity but more often hardening into dismissive rejection. But there are signs now of a more sympathetic interest and an increasing readiness to admit and explore shared concerns, even if these are still expressed in a very different idiom and intellectual context. Vincent Descombes offers here a personal guide to the main movements and figures of the last forty-five years. He traces over this period the evolution of thought from a generation preoccupied with the &#39;three H&#39;s&#39; - Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, to a generation influenced since about 1960 by the &#39;three masters of suspicion&#39; - Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. In this framework he deals in turn with the thought of Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, the early structuralists, Foucault, Althusser, Serres, Derrida, and finally Deleuze and Lyotard. The &#39;internal&#39; intellectual history of the period is related to its institutional setting and the wider cultural and political context which has given French philosophy so much of its distinctive character.</p><p>An introduction to modern French philosophy (1933 to the present) which expresses the main movements and figures in their political and cultural contexts.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Swiss Family Robinson (Puffin Pixels)</h2><p><b>Embrace your inner geek with Puffin Pixels<br><br>Puffin Pixels </b>is a new collection of classics featuring pixelated, 8-bit video game cover artwork.

Brower shares his knowledge of whaling, pioneering, and Alaska Native life and customs before statehood, chronicling a period of important and rapid change in Alaska history with insight and humor. His story is also full of high adventure and rich with details about the many visitors who became his friends--explorers, whalers, traders, and missionaries. This volume is an excellent companion to the oral biography of Harry Brower, Jr., the son of Charles Brower, entitled <i>The Whales, They Give Themselves</i> (University of Alaska Press 2004).</p><p><b>Charles Brower</b>, the "King of the Arctic," was born in New York City in 1863. At the age of twenty, he was invited to join a small party to investigate coal mining possibilities near Cape Lisburne, Alaska, on the Arctic Ocean. Attracted by the lure of wide horizons and far places, he accepted the invitation. Except for occasional visits "Outside," Brower remained within the Arctic Circle for the rest of his life, living and working at Point Barrow, Alaska, where he died in 1945.</p><h2>Herein Is Love, Vol. 1: Genesis</h2><p>This book is truly wonderful. It has captured parents and children with creative, gripping, and beautiful portrayals of what truly happened in the beginning. The beginning books of the Bible are essential to our understanding of God&#39;s redemptive story. The author of Herein Is Love creatively focuses our attention on the events that bring this story to life. The series has the richness of well-written literature and the depth of understanding inherent in a commentary. The result is a series of books whose details live and sing. They help parent and child understand the Christ-centered Word, and they are enjoyable reading for both. Your own faith will be strengthened while reading to your children, and your children will be encouraged, lesson by lesson, to believe in the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Nancy Ganz has spent the last twenty years in her native land of Canada, helping her husband, Dr. Richard Ganz, in church-planting work and home-schooling their four daughters. She received her formal theological training from the University of Toronto prior to her conversion to Christ at L Abri in the Netherlands. However, it has been the many years of Bible study since that time which has produced here Herein is Love commentaries on the Old Testament. Currently, most of her time is spent studying the Scriptures, writing various books, and taking long walks along the country roads and woodland paths near her home.Bible commentaries for children? Yes, the depth of Bible commentaries in story form for parents to read to their children. This series of books provides what children need solid truths to grow in to. Too much material for children is so light and fluffy that children are not encouraged to think great and glorious thoughts about God. These books are different. Artfully written, they beautifully draw out the implications of the Old Testament narrative that are foundational for Christian faith. I guarantee that your children will not want you to stop reading these books and you won t want to stop either. --Dr. Tedd Tripp<br><br>Interesting and very competent ... a major contribution! --Dr. D. A. Carson<br><br>Nancy Ganz's commentaries for children are unique in their field. They masterfully combine biblical theology, covenantal theology, historical theology, and practical theology, such that both children and adults may profit immensely from them. Children are gripped by them. They are great aids for parents in family worship. Even pastors can learn from them, particularly in how to bring truth to the mind and conscience of the young. --Joel R.

Cano thought such matters were not for the likes of 'carpenters' wives,' presumably unconscious of the irony in his choice of the word carpenter. A valuable contribution to a fascinating and revealing area of study."<b>---J. S. Cummins, <i>History</i></b><br><br>"Spanish Catholicism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has attracted considerable scholarly attention over the years. The work of theologians, humanists, mystics, and saints has been one focus of that attention.

A useful addition to the literature on Spanish religiosity in the sixteenth century."<b>---Carla Rahn Phillips, <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i></b><br><br>"Dr. Christian is . . . To be congratulated for bringing these reports [of Philip II's chroniclers] to our attention.

This is the story of the Willoweed family and the English village in which they live. It begins mid-flood, ducks swimming in the drawing-room windows, &#34;quacking their approval&#34; as they sail around the room. &#34;What about my rose beds?&#34; demands Grandmother Willoweed. Her son shouts down her ear-trumpet that the garden is submerged, dead animals everywhere, she will be lucky to get a bunch. Then the miller drowns himself...then the butcher slits his throat...and a series of gruesome deaths plagues the villagers. The newspaper asks, &#34;Who will be smitten by this fatal madness next?&#34; Through it all, Comyns&#39; unique voice weaves a text as wonderful as it is horrible, as beautiful as it is cruel. Originally published in England in 1954, this &#34;overlooked small masterpiece&#34; is a twisted, tragicomic gem.</p><p>Barbara Comyns (1909-92) was born in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire. She was an artist and writer, worked in advertising, dealt in old cars and antiques, bred poodles and developed property. She was twice married, and she and her second husband lived in Spain for eighteen years, returning to the UK in the early 1970s. She is the author of eleven books, including Sisters by a River (1947), Our Spoons Came from Woolworths (1950), The Vet&#39;s Daughter (1959), The Skin Chairs (1962) and A Touch of Mistletoe (1967). She died in Shropshire in 1992.Originally published in 1954 and largely overlooked in its time, Comyns's dark novel begins in the midst of a devastating flood in a small English village. As the "ducks through the drawing-room windows" the Willoweed family surveys the damage. "Grandmother Willoweed" ("a dreadful old black bird, enormous and horrifying, all weighed down by jet and black plumes") shares the estate with her preacher son Ebin, recently made a widower, his three motherless children and their servants, a handyman called Old Ives, and two domestics. Shortly after the flood, several villagers become afflicted with a mysterious illness, causing some to commit suicide. When the pitiful Ebin loses one of his children to the sickness as well, he becomes determined to sever ties with his family's insufferable matriarch and, he hopes, improve his life. Evenson notes in his introduction that Comyns's "third person narration is quite democratic in terms of who it chooses to attend to" and indeed she shifts perspectives from the Willoweeds to various doomed members of the community with the ease and dexterity of a natural storyteller. Her dark, nightmare-inducing imagery makes for an unforgettable read, then and now. (Nov.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Through the course of these first three novels, Roger has grown from a spoiled brat into a true leader of men and aliens alike. <i>March to the Stars</i> takes the Bronze Barbarians of the Imperial Guard across the Eastern Ocean of Marduk, facing giant sea monsters and pirates, and eventually to a spaceport held by humans of questionable loyalties. The naval battle with Mardukian pirates contains some swashbuckling heroics worthy of Errol Flynn himself, and Roger learns that not everything is as it seems on either Marduk or Earth. Fortunately, he's got the Bronze Barbarians and the Basik's Own at his back. <p> Collaboration is a tricky art form, and the resulting work can often feel rough and blocky, with the writers' differing styles at odds. Weber and Ringo deliver a work with a smooth blending of style, serving up a sum that is indeed greater than its parts.

The text of the play is presented with discussions of Shakespeare&#39;s life and world, dramatic criticism, and textual commentaries.</p><p>William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, on England&#x2019;s Avon River. When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.</p><h2>Eric Stanton &amp; the History of the Bizarre Underground</h2><p><i><b>WINNER:&nbsp;</b><b>2018&nbsp;Foreword INDIES Award</b></i><br>The illustrated story of Eric Stanton and the rise of American fetish art, featuring Steve Ditko, Bettie Page, John Willie, Charles Guyette, Irving Klaw,&nbsp;Leonard Burtman, Edward Mishkin,&nbsp;and Gene Bilbrew.

Characters such as the absurdly criminalised Valjean, the street urchin Gavroche, the rascal Thenardier, the implacable detective Javert, and the pitiful figure of the prostitute Fantine and her daughter Cosette, have entered the pantheon of literary dramatis personae.</p></p><p>The best-known of the French Romantic writers, Victor Hugo was a poet, novelist, dramatist, and political critic. Hugo was an avid supporter of French republicanism and advocate for social and political equality, themes that reflect most strongly in his works Les Mis?rables, Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), and Le Dernier jour d'un condamn? (The Last Day of a Condemned Man). Hugo's literary works were successful from the outset, earning him a pension from Louis XVIII and membership in the prestigious Acad?mie fran?aise, and influencing the work of literary figures such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Elevated to the peerage by King Louis-Philippe, Hugo played an active role in French politics through the 1848 Revolution and into the Second and Third Republics. Hugo died in 1885, revered not only for his influence on French literature, but also for his role in shaping French democracy. He is buried in the Panth?on alongside Alexandre Dumas and ?mile Zola.<br><br>Keith Carabine, Senior Honorary Research Fellow, University of Kent at Canterbury, and Chair of the Joseph Conrad Society (UK), is the author of The Life and Art: A Study of Conrad's 'Under Western Eyes' (1996) and the literary editor of Wordsworth Classics.

Geoffrey Bennington's account of Derrida leads the reader through the philosopher's familiar yet widely misunderstood work on language and writing to the less familiar themes of signature, sexual difference, law, and affirmation. In an unusual and unprecedented "dialogue," Derrida responds to Bennington's text by interweaving Bennington's text with surprising and disruptive "periphrases." Truly original, this dual and dueling text opens new dimensions in Derrida's thought and work.<br><br>"Bennington is a shrewd and well-informed commentator whose book should do something to convince the skeptics . . . that Jacques Derrida's work merits serious attention."&#x2014;Christopher Norris, <i>New Statesman &amp; Society</i><br><br>"Geoffrey Bennington and Jacques Derrida have presented a fascinating example of what might be called post-structuralist autobiography."&#x2014;Laurie Volpe, <i>French Review</i><br><br>"Bennington's account of what Derrida is up to is better in almost all respects&#x2014;more intelligent, more plausible, more readable, and less pretentious&#x2014;than any other I have read."&#x2014;Richard Rorty, <i>Contemporary Literature</i></p><p>Geoffrey Bennington sets out here to write a systematic account of the thought of Jacques Derrida. Responding to Bennington&#39;s text at every turn is Derrida&#39;s own excerpts from his life and thought that, appearing at the bottom of each page, resist circumscription. Together these texts, as a dialogue and a contest, constitute a remarkably in-depth, critical introduction to one of the leading philosophers of the twentieth century and, at the same time, demonstrate the illusions inherent in such a project. Bennington&#39;s account of Derrida, broader in scope than any previously done, leads the reader through the philosopher&#39;s familiar yet still widely misunderstood work on language and writing to the less familiar and altogether more mysterious themes of signature, sexual difference, law, and affirmation. Seeking to escape this systematic rendering - in fact, to prove it impossible - Derrida interweaves Bennington&#39;s text with surprising and disruptive &#34;periphrases&#34;: reflections on his mother&#39;s death agony, commentaries on St. Augustine&#39;s Confessions, memories of childhood, remarks on Judaism, and references to his collaborator&#39;s efforts. This extraordinary book offers, on the one hand, a clear and compelling account of one of the most difficult and important contemporary thinkers and, on the other, one of that thinker&#39;s strangest and most unexpected texts. Far from putting an end to the need to discuss Derrida, Bennington&#39;s text might have originally intended or pretended, this dual text opens new dimensions in the philosopher&#39;s thought and work and extends its challenge.<b>Geoffrey Bennington </b>is the Asa G.

And it is filled with countless smaller stories that teach us about people, history, and the nature of God. It's no surprise that God would choose to reveal himself to us in story--after all, he hardwired us for story. Despite this, we so often attempt to share our faith with others not through story but through systems, arguments, and talking points--methods that appeal only to our mind and neglect our imagination and our emotions.<br><br>In this groundbreaking book, scholar and author Alister McGrath lays a foundation for narrative apologetics. Exploring four major biblical narratives, enduring stories from our culture such as Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, and personal narratives from people such as St. Augustine and Chuck Colson, McGrath shows how we can both understand and share our faith in terms of story.</p><p><b>Alister E.

Within a year, the Maya rebels had almost succeeded in driving their oppressors from the peninsula; by 1855, when the major battles ended, the war had killed or put to flight almost half of the population of Yucat�n.

Instead, the nation has fought limited wars against much weaker states, such as North Korea, North Vietnam, and Iraq. This revised and updated edition of <i>Presidential Decisions for War</i> analyzes the means by which four presidents have taken the nation to war and assesses the effectiveness of each president's leadership during those conflicts. </p><p>Gary Hess recreates the unfolding crises in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq to probe the reasons why Presidents Truman, Johnson, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush and their advisors decided in favor of war. He compares the performance of the commanders-in-chief and evaluates how effectively each understood U.S. interests, explored alternatives to war, adhered to constitutional processes, and built congressional, popular, and international support. A new conclusion points out, that unlike the administrations of Truman, Johnson, and the elder Bush, George W. Bush's White House actively sought to change the international order through preemptive war and aggressive democracy building. </p><p>Fully revised and featuring an examination of how each of the presidents learned from history and juggled the demands on diplomacy, this comparative study of presidential war-making elucidates how effective executive leadership&#x2015;or its absence&#x2015;directly affects the outcome of wars.</p></p><p><p><b>Gary R.

A. Square, the slightly befuddled narrator, is born into a place limited to two dimensions&#x2014;irrevocably flat&#x2014;and peopled by a hierarchy of geometrical forms. In a Gulliver-like tour of his bizarre homeland, A. Square spins a fascinating tale of domestic drama and political turmoil, from sex among consenting triangles to the intentional subjugation of Flatland&#x2019;s females. He tells of visits to Lineland, the world of one dimension, and Pointland, the world of no dimension. But when A. Square dares to speak openly of a third, or even a fourth, dimension, his tragic fate climaxes a brilliant parody of Victorian society. An underground favorite since its publication in England in1884, <i>Flatland</i> is as prophetic a science fiction classic as the works of H. G. Wells, introducing aspects of relativity and hyperspace years before Einstein&#x2019;s famous theories. And it does so with wonderful, enduring enchantment.<br>&nbsp;<br>With an Introduction by Valerie Smith and a New Afterword by John Allen Paulos</p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a na�ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy.

Kellert (forestry and environmental studies, Yale U.) demonstrates human connections with nature, discussing the material necessities which the natural world provide and also less substantial contributions to intellectual capacity, emotional bonding, aesthetic attraction, creativity, imagination, and the recognition of a purposeful existence. These expressions of biophilia, the author argues, are integral to overall health, and the ongoing degradation of the environment might have consequences that people have not yet considered. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Do human beings have an innate, biologically-based attraction to nature? According to Stephen R. Kellert, author of <i>Kinship to Mastery</i>, "biophilia" is a distinct possibility. Certainly humankind's relationship with the physical world has long been evident in our dependence on nature for the tools of survival--everything from clothing to fossil fuel--but is there also a deeper, less obvious role that nature plays in our lives? Kellert posits that our abilities to emotionally bond, to create, imagine, or even simply recognize our existence as purposeful all stem from our relationships with the world around us. <p> And if our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being depends on the natural world, then the environment's degradation could have more disastrous effects than we realize. With <i>Kinship to Mastery</i>, Stephen Kellert presents yet another element in the ongoing debate over conservation, growth, and the environment; this is a book well worth reading.</p>Stephen R.

The closing argument is the "game point" of law, the time when lawyers pull out all the stops on the cajoling and the litigating. Michael S. Lief and his coauthors have collected the closing arguments from 10 noteworthy cases in this volume, introducing each speech with background information on the trial and commentary on the lawyer's technique. In these pages, readers get front-row seats to some of the most riveting trials in this century, including the Charles Manson murder trial, Karen Silkwood's wrongful-death suit, and the trial of the Chicago Seven.<p> Because the authors chose to include all the courtroom interruptions in the transcript, the Manson summation makes for especially lively reading. Manson and his codefendants repeatedly spoke out of turn during prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's statement, saying things like "You are going to be eaten up by your own lie" and "Even if I have never been in the Gotham Bank!" Bugliosi's speech is among the most eloquent in the collection, which is why it is so stunning when one of the defendants provokes him so much that he loses his cool and calls her a name that rhymes with <i>rich</i>.</p><p> Although the title promises the "greatest closing arguments in modern law," some of the speeches seem to have been chosen because they were connected to important cases rather than because of their own rhetorical merits. However, the cases themselves are interesting, and these transcripts bring them to life better than any summary would. This collection should be of interest to anyone in the legal profession. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p>H. Mitchell Caldwell <i>(left)</i> is a professor of law at Pepperdine University School of Law.

This collection of stories of the eventful lives and strong characters of a number of Aboriginal women offers a more intimate and personal view. Their lives span a century of history in fifteen communities scattered from Cape York Peninsula, Arnhem Land and East Kimberley to the Western Desert, the Centre, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. One of these stories is an autobiography and each of the others contains transcriptions or translations of a woman&#39;s own reminiscences, with additional details given by the author. Some women recall the first time they saw a European in their land, others tell how Europeans had influenced their communities generations before they were born. While the authors lived in Aboriginal communities in order to study some particular aspect of the society, the women they describe here became their close friends, companions and helpers, and this book is a record of friendships formed against differences of background, experiences and age. Allegiance to family and familiar territory shapes the personal histories of Aborigines in ways scarcely appreciated by people reared in nuclear family households in cities. The strength of family and community ties can be better understood through reading about the women who contribute so much to the maintenance of these communities.</p><p>ISOBEL WHITE is an anthropologist who has lived with Aboriginal people in South Australia while studying women&#39;s social and ceremonial life.

Idwal Jones's urbane novel follows the young provincial Jean as he attempts to master culinary art at the hands of Paris's most distinguished chefs. Jean will win his high bonnet and the royal bearing that accompanies it - but not until he's had many outrageous adventures, in the kitchen and out. <br><br><b>High Bonnet</b> is a sly send-up of the seething politics, subtle artistry, and enslavement to the palate that constitute life behind the kitchen's swinging doors. First published in 1945 and out of print for more than four decades, <b>High Bonnet</b> will delight readers of Anthony Bourdain's bestselling <b>Kitchen Confidential</b> or of Ludwig Bemelmans's <b>Hotel Splendide</b>.</p><p>The high bonnet of Idwal Jones's book, published in 1945 and now reprinted by the Modern Library Food series, is the chef's toque, a symbol of his stature, of cooking itself. Achieving the high bonnet is the good fortune of the novel's Jean-Marie Gallois, a young <i>confisseur</i> (candy maker) from Provence who has earned an apprenticeship at Paris's famed Faisen d'Or restaurant. But Jean-Marie's ascension to glory is not the novel's central concern; revealing a world entirely devoted to food--getting it, eating it, and discussing it--is. In prose as sensually provocative as the dishes his characters enjoy, Jones acquaints readers with a world dedicated to pursuing pleasure at the table and the craft that makes it, in its culinary dimension at least, most possible. The joy and art of <i>High Bonnet</i> is that its readers instantly ally themselves with the characters--with their mania for dining high, low, and outrageous (on the perfect Potage Cr�cy <i>and</i> prehistoric muskox, for example). It's an exciting feat.<p> Early in the book, we meet the Baroness, who eats "with eyes half drooped, like a pigeon's in flight, allowing [a] croustade to splinter under her excellent teeth." Jones's splendid creation is also responsible for sending Jean-Marie to his apprenticeship, and thus to our encountering a Vietnamese anarchist; Guido, the roguish Italian kitchen expediter; a dwarf <i>r�tissuer</i>; an alcoholic waiter; a saffron-stashing sauce master, and many more extraordinary characters. Meals are enjoyed and stories are told, like that of a man "ruined by a dish," the creator of a legendary curry recipe who falls disastrously from great heights when he can no longer obtain the dish's "secret" ingredient. A philosophy is also put before us: "Never expect a perfect dinner to come from a clean kitchen," says a character; "as well as expect one from a laboratory." In our own age of mass cooking, it's particularly alluring to follow the adventures of Jean-Marie and company. <i>High Bonnet</i> is a window on a lost world and human activity that today cries for the book's vital passion. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"Exciting and entertaining....

The explanation is undoubtedly that the subject is still in a stage of early development, and that the methodologies have still a very limIted applicability. It is not possible to give rules for general application of fracture mechanics concepts. Yet our comprehension of cracking and fracture beha viour of materials and structures is steadily increasing. Further developments may be expected in the not too distant future, enabling useful prediction of fracture safety and fracture characteristics on the basis of advanced fracture mechanics procedures. The user of such advanced procedures ml:lst have a general understanding of the elementary concepts, which are provided by this volume. Emphasis was placed on the practical application of fracture mechanics, but it was aimed to treat the subject in a way that may interest both metallurgists and engineers. For the latter, some general knowledge of fracture mechanisms and fracture criteria is indispensable for an apprecia� tion of the limita tions of fracture mechanics. Therefore a general discussion is provIded on fracture mechanisms, fracture criteria, and other metal� lurgical aspects, wIthout going into much detail. Numerous references are provided to enable a more detailed study of these subjects which are still in a stage of speculative treatment.</p><p></p><h2>Pharmacy Technician &#x2013; PTCE (Quickstudy Medical)</h2><p>Essential quick reference and review for the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE), one of the four requirements for certification.

Why did John Steinbeck's <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> and Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i> incite social change and become literary classics? Why did Sebastian Yunger's real-life adventure <i>A Perfect Storm</i> leap onto the bestseller list? In this book, Philip Gerard analyzes books that made a difference-fiction and nonfiction, classic and contemporary-distilling out the elusive ingredients that make a work memorable, one that changes our minds and our lives. Beginning with the importance of choosing powerful subjects and themes, Gerard encourages writers to explore what is closest to their hearts. He then presents dozens of practical storytelling strategies that engage readers and move them- to tears and laughter, or to action. As in his much-praised <i>Creative Nonfiction</i>, Gerard's instruction is always accessible and a pleasure to read. Anyone who dreams of writing a book that makes a difference will come away with a clear understanding of what it takes to succeed.</p><p>There are countless would-be authors out there who would be thrilled to write a book, any book. <i>Writing a Book That Makes a Difference</i> is not for them. It is for those writers ready to tackle what its author, Philip Gerard, calls the Big Book, "the book that will take the best that is in [them] and every bit of craft [they] can muster." Think <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, <i>The Perfect Storm</i>. Those with ambitions to write a book that will change their lives and the lives of their readers will find Gerard a wise companion, with guidance on choosing and researching your subject, discovering your themes, and building your book, be it fiction or nonfiction. Respect your subject, your material, yourself, and your reader, Gerard urges. Work with integrity, and don't let your experiences (or lack thereof) restrict you. According to Gerard, "No subject is off limits. To any writer. Ever." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Philip Gerard is the author of three novels, most recently <i>Desert Kill</i>, and a memoir, <i>Brilliant Passage</i>.

Thapar has incorporated the vast changes in scholarly understanding and interpretation of Indian history that have occurred during her lifetime to revise the book for a new generation of readers. This new work brings to life thousands of years of history, tracing India's evolution before contact with modern Europe was established: its prehistoric beginnings; the great cities of the Indus civilization; the emergence of mighty dynasties such as the Mauryas, Guptas, and Cholas; the teachings of the Buddha; the creation of heroic epics such as the <i>Mahabharata </i>and the <i>Ramayana; </i>and the creation of regional cultures. Thapar introduces figures from the remarkable visionary ruler Ashoka to other less exemplary figures. In exploring subjects as diverse as marriage, class, art, erotica, and astronomy, Thapar provides an incomparably vivid and nuanced picture of India. Above all, she shows the rich mosaic of diverse kingdoms, landscapes, languages, and beliefs.</p><p>"Romila Thapar is the most eminent Indian historian. This superb book is not only the basic history of how India came to be and an introduction to how the writing of history takes shape, but also, not the least, a deconstruction of the historical myth and inventions on which is based the present intolerant and exclusivist Hindu nationalism. It is essential reading today."&#x2014;Eric Hobsbawm<br><br>"One of the world's most eminent historians of India, Thapar gives us a thoroughly revised edition of her authoritative general history. This one contains the accumulated research of the last thirty years and includes richly textured accounts of life in ancient India. Like its predecessor, this is indispensable reading for anyone interested in India's long and complex history."&#x2014;Thomas R. Metcalf, Professor of History and Sarah Kailath Professor of Indian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of <i>A Concise History of India</i><br><br>"Incorporating newer findings, methods, and interpretations, this thorough and outstandingly written addition to the author's highly acclaimed <i>History of India, Volume One</i> manifests her long and distinguished service to the study of Indian history. Thapar's skillful analysis of how India's past has been interpreted not only brings greater clarity to the understanding of contemporary India, but also contributes usefully to a broader study of history and historiography."&#x2014;Peter L.

It not only anticipates but argues many of the ideas to be found in his famous <em>Being and Nothingness.</em> By subjecting the emotion theories of his day to critical analysis, Sartre opened up the world of psychology to new and creative ways of interpreting feelings. Emotions are intentional and strategic ways of coping with difficult situations. We choose to utilize them, <em>we</em> control <em>them</em>, and not the other way around, as has been posited elsewhere. Emotions are not fixed; they have no essence and indeed are subject to rapid fluctuations and about-turns.

White and His World: The Art and Craft of Photography, 1895&#x2013;1925</h2><p><b>Restoring a gifted art photographer to his place in the American canon and, in the process, reshaping and expanding our understanding of early 20th-century American photography</b><br><br> Clarence H. White (1871&#x2013;1925) was one of the most influential art photographers and teachers of the early 20th century and a founding member of the Photo-Secession. This beautiful publication offers a new appraisal of White&#x2019;s contributions, including his groundbreaking aesthetic experiments, his commitment to the ideals of American socialism, and his embrace of the expanding fields of photographic book and fashion illustration, celebrity portraiture, and advertising. Based on extensive archival research, the book challenges the idea of an abrupt rupture between prewar, soft-focus idealizing photography and postwar &#x201c;modernism&#x201d; to paint a more nuanced picture of American culture in the Progressive era.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Clarence H. White and His World</i> begins with the artist&#x2019;s early work in Ohio, which shares with the nascent Arts and Crafts movement the advocacy of hand production, closeness to nature, and the simple life. White&#x2019;s involvement with the Photo-Secession and his move to New York in 1906 mark a shift in his production, as it grew to encompass commercial portraiture and an increasing commitment to teaching, which ultimately led him to establish the first institutions in America to combine instruction in both technical and aesthetic aspects of photography.The book also incorporates new formal and scientific analysis of White&#x2019;s work and techniques, a complete exhibition record, and many unpublished illustrations of the moody outdoor scenes and quiet images of domestic life for which he was revered.&nbsp;</p><p>This beautiful publication reasserts the importance of innovative art photographer and teacher Clarence H. White, who was a peer of Alfred Stieglitz and fellow founding member of the Photo-Secession.<br> &nbsp;<b>Anne McCauley </b>is David Hunter McAlpin Professor of the History of Photography and Modern Art at Princeton University.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Life&#39;s Devices: The Physical World of Animals and Plants (Princeton Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>This entertaining and informative book describes how living things bump up against non-biological reality. "My immodest aim," says the author, "is to change how you view your immediate surroundings." He asks us to wonder about the design of plants and animals around us: why a fish swims more rapidly than a duck can paddle, why healthy trees more commonly uproot than break, how a shark manages with such a flimsy skeleton, or how a mouse can easily survive a fall onto any surface from any height.</p><br><p> The book will not only fascinate the general reader but will also serve as an introductory survey of biomechanics. On one hand, organisms cannot alter the earth's gravity, the properties of water, the compressibility of air, or the behavior of diffusing molecules. On the other, such physical factors form both constraints with which the evolutionary process must contend and opportunities upon which it might capitalize. Life's Devices includes examples from every major group of animals and plants, with references to recent work, with illustrative problems, and with suggestions of experiments that need only common household materials.</p></p><p>How might we begin looking at living things? The ecologist, Marston Bates, once made a suggestion, saying &#39;I think I&#39;ll start with a rabbit sitting under a raspberry bush and from this gradually go into the mechanics of the situation.&#39; This book is about just that--the mechanics of the situation."A brilliant and eccentric book that looks at living things from an engineering point of view, assuming astonishingly little previous knowledge of science on the reader's part."

From his father, a professor of French history, he acquired a love for studying the past, and he knew from an early age that he too would become a historian. He received his B.A. from Fordham University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1970. In graduate school he became fascinated by the history of the law and the interaction between law and politics, interests that he has maintained throughout his career. In 1969 he joined the History Department of the University of Texas at Austin, where he is now the John Green Regents Professor in History. The winner of several teaching awards, Levack teaches a wide variety of courses on British and European history, legal history, and the history of witchcraft. For eight years he served as the chair of his department, a rewarding but challenging assignment that made it difficult for him to devote as much time as he wished to his teaching and scholarship. His books include "The Civil Lawyers in England, 1603-1641: A Political Study (1973), The Formation of the British State: England, Scotland and the Union, 1603-1707 (1987), and "The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (1987 and 1995), which has been translated into eight languages. <p> His study of the development of beliefs about witchcraft in Europe over the course of many centuries gave him the idea of writing a textbook on Western civilization that would illustrate a broader set of encounters between different cultures, societies, and ideologies. While writing the book, Levack and his two sons built a house on property that he and his wife, Nancy, own in the Texas hill country. He found that the two projectspresented similar challenges: it was easy to draw up the design, but far more difficult to execute it. When not teaching, writing, or doing carpentry work, Levack runs along the jogging trails of Austin, and he has recently discovered the pleasures of scuba diving. </p><p><br> Edward Muir grew up in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, close-by the Emigration Trail along which wagon trains of Mormon pioneers and California-bound settlers made their way westward. As a child he loved to explore the broken-down wagons and abandoned household goods left at the side of the trail and from that acquired a fascination with the past. Besides the material remains of the past, he grew up with stories of his Mormon pioneer ancestors and an appreciation for how the past continued to influence the present. During the turbulent 1960s, he became interested in Renaissance Italy as a period and a place that had been formative for Western civilization. His biggest challenge is finding the time to explore yet another new corner of Italy and its restaurants.</p><p> He received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University where he specialized in the Italian Renaissance and did archival research in Venice and Florence, Italy. He is now the Clarence L. Ver Steeg Professor in the Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University and former chair of the History Department. At Northwestern he has won several teaching awards. His books include, "Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice (Princeton, 1981); Mad Blood Stirring: Vendetta in Renaissance Italy (Johns Hopkins, 1993 and 1998); and "Ritual in Early Modern Europe (Cambridge, 1997). </p><p>Some years ago Ed began to experiment with the use of historical trials in teaching anddiscovered that students loved them. From that experience he decided to write this textbook, which employs trials as a central feature. Ed lives beside Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois. His twin passions are skiing in the Rocky Mountains and rooting for the Chicago Cubs, who manage every summer to demonstrate that winning isn't everything. </p><p><br> Michael Maas was born in the Ohio River Valley, a community that had been a frontier outpost during the late eighteenth century. He grew up reading the stories of the early settlers and their struggles with the native peoples, and seeing in the urban fabric how the city had subsequently developed into a prosperous coal and steel town, with immigrants from all over the world. As a boy he developed a lifetime interest in the archaeology and history of the ancient Mediterranean world and began to study Latin. At Cornell University he combined his interests in cultural history and the Classical world by majoring in Classics and Anthropology. A semester in Rome clinched his commitment to these fields -- and to Italian cooking. Michael went on to get his PhD in the Graduate Program in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology at UC Berkeley.</p><p> He has traveled widely in the Mediterranean and the Middle East and participated in several archaeological excavations, including an underwater dig in Greece. Since 1985 he has taught ancient history at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he founded and directs the interdisciplinary B.A. Program in Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations. He has won several teaching awards.</p><p> Maas' special area of research is Late Antiquity, the period of transition from the Classical to the Medieval worlds, whichsaw the collapse of the Roman Empire in western Europe and the development of the Byzantine state in the east. During his last sabbatical, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J., where he worked on his current book "The Conqueror's Gift. Ethnography, Identity, and Imperial Power at the End of Antiquity (forthcoming). His other books include "John Lydus and the Roman Past. Antiquarianism and Politics in the Age of Justinian (1992); Readings in Late Antiquity: A Sourcebook (2000); and "Exegesis and Empire in the Early Byzantium (2003). </p><p> Maas has always been interested in interdisciplinary teaching and the encounters among different cultures. He sees "The West: Encounters and Transformations as an opportunity to explain how the modern civilization that we call "the West" had its origins in the diverse interactions among many different peoples of antiquity. </p><p><br> Meredith Veldman grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, in a close-knit, closed-in Dutch Calvinist community. In this immigrant society, history mattered: the "Reformed tradition" structured not only religious beliefs but also social identity and political practice. This influence certainly played some role in shaping Veldman's early fascination with history. But probably just as important were the countless World War II re-enactment games she played with her five older brothers. Whatever the cause, Veldman majored in history at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then earned a Ph.D. in modern European history, with a concentration in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Britain, from Northwestern University in 1988.</p><p> As Associate Professor of History at Louisiana State University, Veldman teaches courses in nineteenth- and twentieth-century British history and twentieth-century Europe, as well as the second half of "Western Civ." In her many semesters in the Western Civ classroom, Veldman tried a number of different textbooks but found herself increasingly dissatisfied. She wanted a text that would convey to beginning students at least some of the complexities and ambiguities of historical interpretation, introduce them to the exciting work being done now in cultural history, and, most importantly, tell a good story. The search for this textbook led her to accept the offer made by Levack, Maas, and Muir to join them in writing "The West: Encounters and Transformations.</p><p> The author of "Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain: Romantic Protest, 1945-1980 (1984), Veldman is also the wife of a Methodist minister and the mother of two young sons. They reside in Baton Rouge, where Veldman finds coping with the steamy climate a constant challenge. She and her family recently returned from Manchester, England, where they lived for three years and astonished the natives by their enthusiastic appreciation of English weather.</p></p><h2>The Historians of Ancient Rome: An Anthology of the Major Writings (Routledge Sourcebooks for the Ancient World)</h2><p><p>From reviews of the first edition: "The Historians of Ancient Rome will certainly and deservedly satisfy many, more, in fact, than any of its competitors." <br>-- Bryn Mawr Classical Review<br><br>Covering more than a thousand years of Roman history, The Historians of Ancient Rome is the most comprehensive single volume of ancient sources available in English for the study of Rome.

As a work of social theory, I would argue that it belongs in a class with the writings of Habermas and Arendt&#34;. -- Jay Bernstein, University of Essex This is one of the most original and important works of contemporary European thought. First published in France in 1975, it is the major theoretical work of one of the foremost thinkers in Europe today. Castoriadis offers a brilliant and far-reaching analysis of the unique character of the social-historical world and its relations to the individual, to language, and to nature. He argues that most traditional conceptions of society and history overlook the essential feature of the social-historical world, namely that this world is not articulated once and for all but is in each case the creation of the society concerned. In emphasizing the element of creativity, Castoriadis opens the way for rethinking political theory and practice in terms of the autonomous and explicit self-institution of society.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)Thirty years ago Castoriadis founded the French journal Socialisme ou Barbarie, the title of which stated the alternatives he then saw confronting capitalism. Like Bruno Rizzi, James Burnham, and Milovan Djilas, who worked through an early belief in Marxism to develop a critique of Marxism from the Left, Castoriadis came to conclude that Marxism itself ends in the barbarism of a new class of bureaucrats. The first half of the present work consists of Castoriadis's trenchant critique, while the second half attempts to explain society's origin and function from a new viewpoint. Castoriadis's social theory, a product of more recent years, holds that society arises from the creative imagination, especially in language. Although his presentation is abstract, it is often punctuated by striking examples. This title belongs in most academic collections. Brent A.

His doctor advises him, as a form of therapy, to write his memoirs; in doing so, Zeno reconstructs and ultimately reshapes the events of his life into a palatable reality for himself&#x2013;a reality, however, founded on compromise, delusion, and rationalization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With cigarette in hand, Zeno sets out in search of health and happiness, hoping along the way to free himself from countless vices, not least of which is his accursed &#x201c;last cigarette!&#x201d; (Zeno&#x2019;s famously ineffectual refrain is inevitably followed by a lapse in resolve.) His amorous wanderings win him the shrill affections of an aspiring coloratura, and his confidence in his financial savoir-faire involves him in a hopeless speculative enterprise. Meanwhile, his trusting wife reliably awaits his return at appointed mealtimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zeno&#x2019;s adventures rise to antic heights in this pioneering psychoanalytic novel, as his restlessly self-preserving commentary inventively embroiders the truth. Absorbing and devilishly entertaining, <i>Zeno&#x2019;s Conscience </i>is at once a comedy of errors, a sly testimonial to the joys of procrastination, and a surpassingly lucid vision of human nature by one of the most important Italian literary figures of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>The first new English translation of this classic since 1930 and the first to pay attention to Svevo&#39;s unique use of language and dialect.

His early comedies&#x2014;with their baroque poetic exuberance, intense theatricality, explosive bursts of humor, and superbly concrete realizations of the dialects of love&#x2014;capture as in a chrysalis all that he was to become. They provide a complete inventory of the mind of our greatest writer in the middle of his golden youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This volume contains <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <i>Love's Labor's Lost</i>, <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and it's companion piece, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which Tony Tanner describes in his introduction as "a tragedy by less than one minute." The texts, authoritatively edited by Sylvan Barnet, are supplemented with textual notes, bibliographies, a detailed chronology of Shakespeare's life and times, and a substantial introduction in which Tanner discusses each play individually and in the context of Shakespeare's oeuvre.<br><br></p></p><p>All thirteen of Shakespeare's wonderfully entertaining comedies are contained in this handsome collection, which celebrates the common threads of our humanity, still unchanged from the Bard's own time: the battle between the sexes; the nature of love and friendship; the rule of law and private morality. With occasional complications from disguises, mistaken identities, love triangles and even fairy intervention, these plays continue to speak to new generations with immortal lines such as Lysander's in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>: "the course of true love never did run smooth.William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019; s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including&nbsp;<i>Sir Thomas More</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including&nbsp;<i>Venus and Adonis</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as&nbsp;<i>The Tempest</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Henry VII</i>&nbsp;until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.</p><h2>The Development and Practice of Electronic Music</h2><p>Discusses the origins and basic principles of electronic music and the creative potentials of the tape studio, voltage-controlled synthesizer, and live performance</p><p></p><h2>Insomniac Dreams: Experiments with Time by Vladimir Nabokov</h2><p><p><b>Nabokov's dream diary, published for the first time&#x2015;and placed in biographical and literary context</b></p><p>On October 14, 1964, Vladimir Nabokov, a lifelong insomniac, began a curious experiment. Over the next eighty days, immediately upon waking, he wrote down his dreams, following the instructions he found in <i>An Experiment with Time</i> by the British philosopher John Dunne. The purpose was to test the theory that time may go in reverse, so that, paradoxically, a later event may generate an earlier dream. The result&#x2015;published here for the first time&#x2015;is a fascinating diary in which Nabokov recorded sixty-four dreams (and subsequent daytime episodes) on 118 index cards, which afford a rare glimpse of the artist at his most private. More than an odd biographical footnote, the experiment grew out of Nabokov&#x2019;s passionate interest in the mystery of time, which influenced many of his novels, including the late masterpiece <i>Ada</i>.</p><p><i>Insomniac Dreams</i>, edited by leading Nabokov authority Gennady Barabtarlo, presents the text of Nabokov&#x2019;s dream experiment, illustrated with a selection of his original index cards, and provides rich annotations and analysis that put them in the context of his life and writings. The book also includes previously unpublished records of Nabokov&#x2019;s dreams from his letters and notebooks and shows important connections between his fiction and private writings on dreams and time.</p></p><p><p>"Who needs fantasy fiction when you can plunge through the trapdoor in Nabokov's pillow into his lucid dreamworlds, with Gennady Barabtarlo as sage companion and guide?"<b>--Brian Boyd, author of <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years</i> and <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years</i></b></p><p>"Nabokov's amazing records of his dreams are priceless, and their publication will create a much-deserved critical buzz. They show Nabokov at his most vulnerable, raw, and genuine, giving us rare glimpses into his past, his feelings about his parents, his relationship with his wife and son, and his anxieties and hopes. This is a very important book."<b>--Galya Diment, University of Washington</b></p><p>"Nabokov's notes about his dream experiment offer a private, unguarded view into his inner life during the rich autumn of his genius. By revealing a new facet of Nabokov's fascination with the nature of time and the otherworld, they show his remarkable openness to radical ways of thinking. Gennady Barabtarlo's masterful analysis of Nabokov's notes does full justice to this important contribution to the study of one of the twentieth century's most important writers."<b>--Dana Dragunoiu, Carleton University</b></p><b>Vladimir Nabokov</b> was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1899. After studying French and Russian literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, he launched his literary career in Berlin and Paris, writing innovative fiction, verse, and drama in his native Russian. In 1940 he moved to America, where he wrote some of his greatest works, including <i>Lolita </i>(1955), <i>Pnin</i> (1957), and <i>Pale Fire</i> (1962). He died in Switzerland in 1977. <b>Gennady Barabtarlo</b> (1949&#x2013;2019) was professor of literature at the University of Missouri and the author of a number of books on Nabokov. Barabtarlo also translated into Russian three of Nabokov&#x2019;s novels and all of his English-language short stories.</p><h2>Infinitas Gracias: Contemporary Mexican Votive Painting</h2><p><i>Infinitas Gracias</i> is the first collection of the work of Alfredo Vilchis Roque, one of Mexico's most famous contemporary painters, and his sons. In the tradition of Catholic votives, each painting tells a miraculous tale and gives thanks to the intervening saint. Ablaze with intense color hearkening back to the natural pigment dyes of ancient Mexico, these works portray the kaleidoscope of issues that constitute modern urban existence. With over 200 paintings, from circus adventures to household accidents to adultery, drugs, and prostitution, <i>Infinitas Gracias</i> weaves together a bizarre tapestry of stories, some disturbing, some comical -- all unerringly wrought and profoundly touching.</p><p>Alfredo Vilchis Roque is a self-taught artist whose works are internationally collected and frequently exhibited, including a recent show at the Mexico City Museum.<br><br>Pierre Schwartz is a photographer and teacher who has collaborated on many books on contemporary art and architecture.<br><br>Victoire and Herve Di Rosa live in Miami, where Victoire is Cultural Attache at the French Consulate in Miami and Herve is a contemporary French painter and sculptor known for his cutting edge, multimedia works.Collecting the intensely moving work of a single Mexico City studio, that of <i>retablo</i> master Roque and his sons, this book offers a deep introduction to a vital art form. <i>Retablo</i>, as Roque interprets it, dramatizes in a commissioned work a life-changing incident in which the hand of a saint guided events, and offers a prayer of thanks, often painted at the bottom, in the client's own words. Roque's patrons are often living on the fringes of society and offer gratitude for events such as being saved from rape in an alley while working as a prostitute, for abandoning one's child and recovering it "in time before he was eaten by dogs," and for not dying when illegally crossing the desert between Mexico and the United States. The prayers have a concise honesty that is irresistible, and Roque matches it with colorful figuration that doesn't waste a stroke, yet has richly realized settings&#x2014;from streets to fields, cantinas to bedrooms and churches&#x2014;and conveys a powerful sense of human need and conflict. Divided into short sections ("Parenthood," "Relationships," "Emigration," "Urban Violence" "Illness" and 16 others) that cover more than 30 years of work, the <i>retablos</i> provide a mosaic of Mexico City life. Particularly moving is the "Homosexuality" section, which records complex relationships and negotiations within a largely Catholic society. This varied and beautiful book, with its nearly 200 lushly printed color reproductions, is less "outsider" art than art that is central to the way people live and love. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It critically analyzes basic concepts underlying most theories of justice, including impartiality, formal equality, and the unitary moral subjectivity. The starting point for her critique is the experience and concerns of the new social movements about decision making, cultural expression, and division of labor--that were created by marginal and excluded groups, including women, African Americans, and American Indians, as well as gays and lesbians. Iris Young defines concepts of domination and oppression to cover issues eluding the distributive model. Democratic theorists, according to Young do not adequately address the problem of an inclusive participatory framework. By assuming a homogeneous public, they fail to consider institutional arrangements for including people not culturally identified with white European male norms of reason and respectability. Young urges that normative theory and public policy should undermine group-based oppression by affirming rather than suppressing social group difference. Basing her vision of the good society on the differentiated, culturally plural network of contemporary urban life, she argues for a principle of group representation in democratic publics and for group-differentiated policies.</p><br><p> Danielle Allen's new foreword contextualizes Young's work and explains how debates surrounding social justice have changed since--and been transformed by--the original publication of <i>Justice and the Politics of Difference</i>.</p></p><p><p>"This is an innovative work, an important contribution to feminist theory and political thought, and one of the most impressive statements of the relationship between postmodernist critiques of universalism and concrete thinking.... Iris Young makes the most convincing case I know of for the emancipatory implications of postmodernism."<b>--Seyla Benhabib, Yale University</b></p><b>Iris Marion Young</b> (1949-2006) was a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

McDougall argues powerfully that a pervasive but radically changing faith that &#x201c;God is on our side&#x201d; has inspired U.S. foreign policy ever since 1776. The first comprehensive study of the role played by civil religion in U.S. foreign relations over the entire course of the country&#x2019;s history, McDougall&#x2019;s book explores the deeply infused religious rhetoric that has sustained and driven an otherwise secular republic through peace, war, and global interventions for more than two hundred years. From the Founding Fathers and the crusade for independence to the Monroe Doctrine, through World Wars I and II and the decades-long Cold War campaign against &#x201c;godless Communism,&#x201d; this coruscating polemic reveals the unacknowledged but freely exercised dogmas of civil religion that bind together a &#x201c;God blessed&#x201d; America, sustaining the nation in its pursuit of an ever elusive global destiny.</p><p><b>Walter A. McDougall</b> is professor of history and the Alloy-Ansin Professor of International Relations at the University of Pennsylvania.

Whether American presidents could conduct foreign relations better without the hype of civil religion Mr. McDougall does not say. But he suggests that the national interest might be a better guide to America&#x2019;s conduct in the world."&#x2014;D.G. Hart, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"Walter A. McDougall, . . . who has taken on some of the broadest themes in American society and won a Pulitzer for his brilliant history of the American space program, warns in <i>The Tragedy of U.S. Foreign Policy</i> that once in office American presidents are often 'susceptible to a utopian temptation.' They adopt a language that he describes as 'American civil religion,' wrapping adventurism in a gauzy, semireligious haze."&#x2014;David E.

Training wheels on a bicycle make it easier for a novice to ride, but get in the way after that. </p><p>So it is also with programming languages. Every programming language has aspects that are most likely to cause trouble for people not yet thoroughly familiar with them. These aspects vary from one language to another, but are surprisingly constant from one programmer to another. Thus the idea of collecting them. </p><p>My first effort to collect such problems was in 1977, when I gave a talk called PL/I Traps and Pitfalls at the SHARE (IBM mainframe users' group) meeting in Washington, DC. That was shortly after I moved from Columbia University, where people used PL/I heavily, to AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, where people use C heavily. The decade that followed gave me ample experience in how C programmers (including me) can get themselves into trouble if they're not certain of what they're doing. </p><p>I started collecting C problems in 1985 and published the collection as an internal paper at the end of that year. The response astonished me: more than 2,000 people requested copies of the paper from the Bell Labs library. That convinced me to expand the paper into this book. </p><p> What This Book Is </p><p>C Traps And Pitfalls aims to encourage defensive programming by showing how other people, even experienced professionals, have gotten themselves into trouble. These mistakes are generally easy to avoid once seen and understood, so the emphasis is on specific examples rather than generalities. </p><p>This book belongs on your shelf if you are using C at all seriously, even if you are an expert: many of the professional C programmers who saw early drafts said things like "that bug bit me just last week!" If you are teaching a course that uses C, it belongs at the top of your supplementary reading list. What This Book Is Not </p><p>This book is not a criticism of C. Programmers can get themselves into trouble in any language. I have tried here to distill a decade of C experience into a compact form in the hope that you, the reader, will be able to avoid some of the stupid mistakes I've made and seen others make. </p><p>This book is not a cookbook. Errors cannot be avoided by recipe. If they could, we could eliminate automobile accidents by plastering the countryside with "Drive Carefully" signs! People learn most effectively through experience--their own or someone else's. Merely understanding how a particular kind of mistake is possible is a big step on the way to avoiding it in the future. </p><p>This book is not intended to teach you how to program in C (see Kernighan and Ritchie: The C Programming Language, Second Edition, Prentice-Hall 1988), nor is it a reference manual (see Harbison and Steele: C: A Reference Manual, Second Edition, Prentice-Hall, 1987). It does not mention algorithms or data structures (see Van Wyk: Data Structures And C Programs, Addison-Wesley 1988), and only briefly discusses portability (see Horton: How To Write Portable Programs In C., Prentice-Hall 1989) and operating system interfaces (see Kernighan and Pike: The Unix Programming Environment, Prentice-Hall 1984). The problems mentioned are real, although often shortened (for a collection of composed C problems see Feuer: The C Puzzle Book, Prentice-Hall 1982). It is neither a dictionary nor an encyclopedia; I have kept it short to encourage you to read it all. Your Name in Lights </p><p>I'm sure I've missed some pitfalls. If you find one I've missed, please contact me via Addison-Wesley. I may well include your discovery, with an acknowledgement, in a future edition. A Word about ANSI C </p><p>As I write this, the ANSI C standard is not yet final. It is technically incorrect to refer to "ANSI C" until the ANSI committee finishes its work. In practice, though, the ANSI standard is far enough along that nothing I say about ANSI C is likely to change. C compilers are already available that implement many of the significant improvements contemplated by the ANSI committee. </p><p>Don't worry if your C implementation does not support the ANSI function syntax mentioned here: it is easy enough to understand the parts of the examples where it matters, and you can fall into the traps described there regardless of what version of C you use. Acknowledgements </p><p>A collection like this could not possibly have been made in isolation. People who have pointed out particular pitfalls include Steve Bellovin, Mark Brader, Luca Cardelli, Larry Cipriani, Guy Harris and Steve Johnson, Phil Karn, Dave Kristol, George W. Leach, Doug McIlroy, Barbara Moo, Rob Pike, Jim Reeds, Dennis Ritchie, Janet Sirkis, Richard Stevens, Bjarne Stroustrup, Ephraim Vishnaic, and one contributor who wishes to remain anonymous. For brevity, I've mentioned only the first person to report any particular problem to me. Of course, I doubt any of the people I've mentioned actually invented the programming errors they pointed out to me, and if they did I doubt they'd admit it! I know I've made many of them myself too, some several times. </p><p>Useful editorial suggestions came from Steve Bellovin, Jim Coplien, Marc Donner, Jon Forrest, Brian Kernighan, Doug McIlroy, Barbara Moo, Rob Murray, Bob Richton, Dennis Ritchie, Jonathan Shapiro, and several anonymous reviewers. Lee McMahon and Ed Sitar pointed out what would otherwise have ben embarrassing typographical errors in early drafts of the manuscript. Dave Prosser clarified many fine points of ANSI C for me. Brian Kernighan supplied invaluable typesetting tools and assistance. </p><p>It has been a delight to work with the people at Addison-Wesley, including Jim DeWolf, Mary Dyer, Lorraine Ferrier, Katherine Harutunian, Marshall Henrichs, Debbie Lafferty, Keith Wollman, and Helen Wythe. I'm sure they've gained from the aid of others whom I haven't met. </p><p>I am particularly grateful to the enlightened managers at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories who made it possible for me to write this book at all, including Steve Chappell, Bob Factor, Wayne Hunt, Rob Murray, Will Smith, Dan Stanzione, and Eric Sumner. </p><p> The title of this book was suggested by Robert Sheckley's science-fiction anthology The People Trap and Other Pitfalls, Snares, Devices and Delusions (as well as Two Sniggles and a Contrivance), published by Dell Books in 1968. 0201179288P04062001</p></p><h2>Instant Yiddish</h2><p>Lists hundreds of Yiddish words and phrases useful in a variety of circumstances</p><p></p><h2>Ready . . .

But in <em>Aurora Floyd</em>, and in many of the novels written in imitation of it, bigamy is little more than a euphemism, a device to enable the heroine, and vicariously the reader, to enjoy the forbidden sweets of adultery without adulterous intentions. Passionate, sometimes violent, Aurora does succeed in enjoying them, her desires scarcely chastened by her disastrous first marriage. She represents a challenge to the mid-Victorian sexual code, and particularly to the feminine ideal of simpering, angelic young ladyhood. <br><br>P. D. Edward's introduction evaluates the novel's leading place among `bigamy-novels' and Braddon's treatment of the power struggle between the sexes, as well as considering the similarities between the author and her heroine.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

When <em>Aurora Floyd</em> was first published in serial form in 1862-63, Fraser&#x2019;s magazine asserted that &#x201c;a book without a murder, a divorce, a seduction, or a bigamy, is not apparently considered either worth writing or reading; and a mystery and a secret are the chief qualifications of the modern novel.&#x201d;</p> <p> The novel depicts a heroine trapped in an abusive and adulterous marriage, and effectively dramatizes the extra-legal pressures which kept many such unhappy marriages out of the courts: fear of personal scandal, and of betraying one&#x2019;s family through the publicity and expense of the process. Aurora&#x2019;s bigamous marriage dramatizes the need for expeditious divorce without the enormous social cost, but the overt sexuality of the heroine shocked contemporary critics. &#x201c;What is held up to us as the story of the feminine soul as it really exists underneath its conventional coverings, is a very fleshy and unlovely record,&#x201d; wrote Margaret Oliphant. </p> <p> Braddon&#x2019;s text is studded with references to contemporary events (the Crimean War, the Divorce Act of 1857) and the text has been carefully annotated for modern readers in this edition, which also includes a range of documents designed to help set the text in context. </p></p><h2>Academic Vocabulary in Use with Answers</h2><p>The perfect study aid for anyone using English for their academic work.

E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology</h2><p>In this groundbreaking book, Aldon D. Morris&#x2019;s ambition is truly monumental: to help rewrite the history of sociology and to acknowledge the primacy of W. E. B. Du Bois&#x2019;s work in the founding of the discipline. Calling into question the prevailing narrative of how sociology developed, Morris, a major scholar of social movements, probes the way in which the history of the discipline has traditionally given credit to Robert E. Park at the University of Chicago, who worked with the conservative black leader Booker T. Washington to render Du Bois invisible. Morris uncovers the seminal theoretical work of Du Bois in developing a &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; sociology through a variety of methodologies and examines how the leading scholars of the day disparaged and ignored Du Bois&#x2019;s work.<br><br><i>The Scholar Denied</i> is based on extensive, rigorous primary source research; the book is the result of a decade of research, writing, and revision. In exposing the economic and political factors that marginalized the contributions of Du Bois and enabled Park and his colleagues to be recognized as the &#x201c;fathers&#x201d; of the discipline, Morris delivers a wholly new narrative of American intellectual and social history that places one of America&#x2019;s key intellectuals, W. E. B. Du Bois, at its center.<br><br><i>The Scholar Denied</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in American history, racial inequality, and the academy. In challenging our understanding of the past, the book promises to engender debate and discussion.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Scholar Denied,</i> Aldon Morris tests, and convincingly proves, the belief, too long repressed, that W. E. B. Du Bois not only played a pivotal role in the birth of modern scientific sociology in America but was its founding father, on either side of the color line. Toppling prevailing truths like the towering genius at the center of this development, Morris&#x2019;s account offers a fresh and crisply researched reinterpretation of Du Bois&#x2019;s pathbreaking Atlanta school of sociology and is sure to be a major book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alphonse Fletcher University Professor, Harvard University<br><br> &#x201c;Aldon Morris&#x2019;s <i>The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology</i> is one of those landmark studies that change the way we think about a historical occurrence. This well-written book is replete with original insights that challenge conventional wisdom on the origins and development of American sociology. Morris&#x2019;s meticulous scholarship, based on a careful analysis of revealing primary documents as well as secondary sources, details fascinating and new information regarding Du Bois&#x2019;s seminal role in the development of scientific sociology and his relationships with Booker T. Washington, Robert Park, and other members of the Chicago school, and with the preeminent social scientist Max Weber. <i>The Scholar Denied</i> is a must-read for those interested in how race, power, and economics determine the fate of intellectual schools.&#x201d;&#x2014;William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University<br><br> &#x201c;Aldon Morris has given us a great gift: the truth of Du Bois&#x2019;s genius and America&#x2019;s denial of it! Don&#x2019;t miss this pioneering text!&#x201d;&#x2014;Cornel West<br><br> "An eye-opening book! Aldon Morris has written a biography not of W. E. B. Du Bois the man, but of Du Bois's magisterial work and how it fared in the disciplinary scramble for preeminence.

Revealing how this was possible, <i>The Red Atlas </i>is the never-before-told story of the most comprehensive mapping endeavor in history and the surprising maps that resulted.<br><br> From 1950 to 1990, the Soviet Army conducted a global topographic mapping program, creating large-scale maps for much of the world that included a diversity of detail that would have supported a full range of military planning. For big cities like New York, DC, and London to towns like Pontiac, MI and Galveston, TX, the Soviets gathered enough information to create street-level maps. What they chose to include on these maps can seem obvious like locations of factories and ports, or more surprising, such as building heights, road widths, and bridge capacities. Some of the detail suggests early satellite technology, while other specifics, like detailed depictions of depths and channels around rivers and harbors, could only have been gained by actual Soviet feet on the ground. <i>The Red Atlas &nbsp;</i>includes over 350 extracts from these incredible Cold War maps, exploring their provenance and cartographic techniques as well as what they can tell us about their makers and the Soviet initiatives that were going on all around us.<br><br> A fantastic historical document of an era that sometimes seems less distant, <i>The Red Atlas </i>offers an uncanny view of the world through the eyes of Soviet strategists and spies.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>John Davies </b>is editor of <i>Sheetlines</i>, the journal of the Charles Close Society for the Study of Ordnance Survey Maps.

Military cartographers created hundreds of thousands of maps and filled them with detailed notes on the terrain and infrastructure of every place on Earth. It was one of the greatest mapping endeavors the world has ever seen. . . .

Many of the maps in this collection were made to guide Soviet soldiers in potential wars against enemies abroad.&nbsp;But like the best socialist-realist propaganda posters, they transcend their original purpose.&nbsp;Decades after they were created, they are now unique works of art, offering the viewer what can only be called a kind of emotional-cartographic-political experience.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Joe Weisberg, creator and executive producer of &#x201c;The Americans&#x201d;)<br><br>"Fascinating. . . . Lavishly illustrated. . . . If this book merely offered a newly acquired selection of cartographic items, it would still be worth buying and reading. . . . The maps themselves are attractive, and the supporting technical and scholarly apparatus will be helpful to general readers as well as specialists. . . . The true value, however, lies in the careful examination and side-by-side comparison of the Soviet maps with their Western (mostly American and British) counterparts." (<i>Imago Mundi</i>)<br><br>"For anyone interested in maps, this book is a sheer delight. It also carries huge educational and historical value by introducing the inner workings of the Soviet military topography--a little-known and rather fascinating side of the Cold War in its own right."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Geographical</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Red Atlas</i> is an amazing book, especially if you&#x2019;ve ever pondered the power of satellite imagery as a surveillance tool. Military mapping has two modes: mapping one&#x2019;s own territory so you can better defend it, and mapping an opponent&#x2019;s territory so you can attack or take control. Focusing on the latter, <i>The Red Atlas</i> shows the impressive and frightening detail of maps of Western Europe and North American prepared by Soviet cartographers during the Cold War. Overhead imaging with satellites and high-resolution cameras provided the basic geographic canvass and ground intelligence--spies, tourists, and maps sold freely by commercial firms and government surveys--filled in local details such as street names, the height and width of railway overpasses, and the load capacity of bridges. Map collector John Davies collaborated with academic cartographer Alex Kent to tell the story of how the USSR systematically mapped the West&#x2019;s cities, ports, highways, railways, and military targets, and how these maps fell into the hands of map dealers following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their examination of selected examples from Britain and the United States also highlights errors that are revealing in some cases and puzzling in others. The <i>Red Atlas</i> belongs in the collection of every map enthusiast and military historian--carefully researched, well-written, and exquisitely designed and printed, it&#x2019;s perhaps the only recent map history that can be called a real eye-opener.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Mark Monmonier, author of How to Lie with Maps)<br><br><i>&#x201c;</i>Utterly fascinating.

It is rare that a historian of the Left has managed to retain as much credibility while refusing to let his academic mantle change his beautiful writing style from being anything but direct, forthright, and accessible. Whether his subject is war, race, politics, economic justice, or history itself, each of his works serves as a reminder that to embrace one&#39;s subjectivity can mean embracing one&#39;s humanity, that heart and mind can speak with one voice. Here, in six sections, is the historian&#39;s own choice of his shorter essays on some of the most critical problems facing America throughout its history, and today.</p><p>The visionary historical work of professor and activist HOWARD ZINN (1922&#x2013;2010) is widely considered one of the most important and influential of our era. After his experience as a bombardier in World War II, Zinn became convinced that&nbsp;there could no longer be such a thing as a &#x201c;just war,&#x201d; because the vast majority of victims in modern warfare are, increasingly, innocent civilians. In his books, including&nbsp;<i>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, its companion volume<i>Voices of a People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, and countless other titles, Zinn affirms the power of the people to influence the course of events.A welcome collection of essays and occasional pieces by the dean of radical American historians. This portly tome is primarily intended for the Howard Zinn faithful, of course, of whom there are likely to be many; his People's History of the United States has sold 400,000 copies, after all. For the uninitiated, this collection offers a useful introduction to Zinn's idealistic, Marxist-anarchist view of the world, a view he has championed for many decades. Zinn began his career as a historian at Atlanta's Spelman College, then a school for African-American women; fittingly, a large part of his book is given over to first-hand reports on the civil-rights movement in the South. Rejecting too-easy black-versus-white views of the struggle, Zinn insists that class analysis be brought to bear on the study of inequality: ``Once the superficiality of the physical is penetrated and seen for what it is,'' he writes, ``the puzzle of race loses itself in whatever puzzle there is to human behavior in general. Once you begin to look, in human clash, for explanations other than race, they suddenly become visible.'' Elsewhere Zinn combs through the annals of American history to turn up examples of the evils of capitalism, discussing among other subjects the conduct of the Spanish-American War, the brutal suppression of the Filipino Revolt, the origins of the abolitionist movement, and the ironies of the war in Vietnam (he notes that in 1966 the US was paying $34 in condolence money for each Vietnamese civilian accidentally killed in air strikes--but $87 for every rubber tree thus destroyed). When not looking deep into the past, Zinn cheerfully lampoons such conservative foes as the late Allan Bloom, who ``swoons over Plato,'' and generally has a good time arguing for an equitable, just, and division-free America. A worthy gathering for Zinn fans and fledgling historians alike. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Culled from a life of intense seeking, these profound meditations on living, waiting, power, peace, and dying offer important insights that will inspire all who dare to travel a spiritual path.</p><p>Henri Nouwen (1932-1996) is considered one of the great spiritual writers of our day. He is the author of bestsellers such as In the Name of Jesus and Life of the Beloved (both with Crossroad) and has taught at the University of Notre Dame, Yale and Harvard.Nouwen's unexpected death in 1996 ended the prolific writing career of the Dutch Catholic priest who bridged denominational chasms between Christians everywhere. Since then, the Henri Nouwen Literary Centre in Canada has seen that two of Nouwen's unfinished books have been published and has continued to plumb his collection of unpublished papers, manuscripts, letters, tapes and videos for other possibilities. This brief collection is part of that effort. It comprises three previously published Nouwen essays, "The Path of Power," "The Path of Peace" and "The Path of Waiting," and adds a fourth, "The Path of Living and Dying." Based on a talk Nouwen gave at the National Catholic HIV/AIDS Conference in Chicago and an interview with Crosspoint magazine, this last essay is of particular interest as it opens a window to Nouwen's own preparation for his passage into the life he believed awaited him after death. Although Sue Mosteller, literary executrix of the Nouwen Literary Centre, molded Nouwen's thoughts into this essay, her choice and arrangement of words are true to the man's spirit in their frankness and ability to distill a subject's essence. Those familiar with Nouwen's writings will doubtless agree that he could easily have written passages like this: "Death in itself is not wonderful. It is terrible. But how we see our death and the death of others we know and love can be transforming. It takes time. But it is possible." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Republic, Volume I: Books 1-5 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Plato of Athens, who laid the foundations of the Western philosophical tradition and in range and depth ranks among its greatest practitioners, was born to a prosperous and politically active family ca. 427 bce.

His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theater. Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career: "Medicine is my lawful wife," he once said, "and literature is my mistress."Chekhov renounced the theatre after the disastrous reception of <i>The Seagull</i> in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Constantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's&nbsp;<i>Uncle Vanya</i>&nbsp;and premiered his last two plays,&nbsp;<i>Three Sisters</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text."Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.&nbsp;Anton Chekhov was the author of hundreds of short stories and several plays and is regarded by many as both the greatest Russian storyteller and the father of modern drama.</p><h2>Nature</h2><p>Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. He gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, Nature. He wrote on a number of subjects. He remains among the linchpins of the American romantic movement, and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that have followed him. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was "the infinitude of the private man." Starting in 1867, his health began declining; he wrote much less in his journals. Beginning as early as the summer of 1871 or in the spring of 1872, he started having memory problems and suffered from aphasia. By the end of the decade, he forgot his own name at times and, when anyone asked how he felt, he responded, "Quite well; I have lost my mental faculties, but am perfectly well". On April 21, 1882, he was found to be suffering from pneumonia.

(Historians at Work)</h2><p><br>Does the frontier experience make America exceptional? When Frederick Jackson Turner presented this idea in 1893 as the core of his now-famous thesis, he set in motion a debate that historians of the American West have contended with ever since. The concept of a frontier, a moving boundary that defined civilization and circumscribed the Wild West, was not new &#x2014; though the idea that it made Americans unique was. Turner's paper is reprinted in its entirety, followed by articles by three "New Western" historians who bring the dialogue up to the present day by applying modern concerns to this long-standing issue. The last selection looks forward, asking what Turner's ideas mean for America as we head into the twenty-first century.<br></p><p><br><br><b>RICHARD W.

Had a New World society and culture emerged different from those in Western Europe? If so, what was unique about this new America, and how had this new society gradually evolved?<br><br>[T]he most widely circulated statement of American exceptionalism was pronounced in July 1893 in Chicago. Frederick Jackson Turner, a thirty-one-year-old history professor at the University of Wisconsin, appeared before the annual meeting of the American Historical Association to deliver a paper, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History." On that hot and humid July evening�the young historian presented what became the most significant essay about American history. It was a provocative call to understand American identity as primarily the result of the shifting national frontiers, advancing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast.<br><br><i>On Frederick Jackson Turner . . .</i><br><br>In his [1893] essay as in other writings of the 1890s, Turner revealed a great deal about his own background and intellectual maturation. His profound interest in the frontier arose naturally. Born on November 14, 1861, in Portage, Wisconsin, a frontier town of nearly four thousand, Turner grew up in a community awash in the fresh memories of exploration and settlement�.For him, the frontier experience meant the physical movement of European settlers across the American continent. Because of his own background and his attachment to agricultural communities, farmers were the central figures of his frontier story.<br><br><i>On Turner's 1893 frontier essay . . .</i><br><br>Turner told his fellow historians, first of all, that they had to shift their focus�.Like a good drill sergeant, Turner told his troops to do an about-face: They should turn away from Europe toward a westward-moving frontier. There lay the meaning of the country's unique experience. In one terse sentence early in his essay, Turner encapsulated his major themes: "The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development. (199)" If Americans wanted to understand the significance of their past, Turner, like many of his contemporaries, offered a patriotic explanation: the settling of the New World, especially the American frontier, was the most powerful force in shaping exceptional Americans...<br><br>As a committed social and cultural evolutionist, the Wisconsin historian studied the accretions of western experiences that had, over time, been laminated into a composite American character. Turner pointed to several important factors that he saw arising from unique frontier experience: a "composite nationality," which others would later call a melting pot; the "growth of democracy"; an independent individualism; and economic and physical mobility. "The result," Turner concluded, was "that to the frontier the American intellect [owed] its striking characteristics (226-27)."<br><br><i>On the legacy of the Turner thesis. . .</i><br><br>Frederick Jackson Turner occupies a unique position in American historical writing. Beginning his professional career in about 1890, Turner undertook a revision of existing interpretations of the American past, did so successfully, and lived to see his own alternative interpretation of the frontier because the accepted view. No other American historian achieved as much. One hundred years later, near the beginning of another new century, although few historians would call themselves Turnerians, his thesis remains the most widely discussed interpretation of the American past. In the century since Turner presented his thesis in Chicago, however, it has traversed a series of interpretive peaks and valleys.<br><br><i>On modern criticisms of the Turner thesis . . .</i><br><br>Revisionists (those who contradict or revise previous views) of all stripes pointed to many inadequacies in previous writings about the frontier and the American West. So numerous were these attacks that by the 1990s some observers mistakenly declared the frontier thesis essentially dead�however more than a few historians still found much that was acceptable in Turner's ideas.<br><br>The criticism was of several kinds. Some historians emphasized what they considered the weaknesses of the frontier school in acknowledging the large contributions of racial and ethnic minorities to the history of the frontier and the West. No less pointed were the attacks launched against frontier historians for failing to deal with the important questions of gender and class. Some critics also harpooned western specialists for ignoring the post-1900 West and significant urban and environmental subjects. Although most did not explicitly address the subject of exceptionalism, they implied that a perspective as shaky as they now considered the frontier thesis could not be the basis for a tenable interpretation of American culture.<br><br></p><h2>Kamasutra</h2><p><em>The Kamasutra</em> is the oldest extant textbook of erotic love. But it is more than a book about sex. It is about the art of living--about finding a partner, maintaining power in a marriage, committing adultery, living as or with a courtesan, using drugs--and also, of course, about the many and varied positions available to lovers in sexual intercourse and the pleasures to be derived from each. <br> <em>The Kamasutra</em> was composed in Sanskrit, the literary language of ancient India, sometime in the third century, probably in North India. It combines an encyclopedic coverage of all imaginable aspects of sex with a closely observed sexual psychology and a dramatic, novelistic narrative of seduction, consummation, and disentanglement. Best known in English through the highly mannered, padded, and inaccurate nineteenth-century translation by Sir Richard Burton, the text is newly translated here into clear, vivid, sexually frank English. This edition also includes a section of vivid Indian color illustrations along with three uniquely important commentaries: translated excerpts from the earliest and most famous Sanskrit commentary (thirteenth century) and from a twentieth-century Hindi commentary, and explanatory notes by the two translators.<br> The lively and entertaining introduction by translator Wendy Doniger, one of the world's foremost Sanskrit scholars, discusses the history of <em>The Kamasutra</em> and its reception in India and Europe, analyses its attitudes toward gender and sexual violence, and sets it in the context of ancient Indian social theory, scientific method, and sexual ethics.</p><p><br><strong>Wendy Doniger</strong> is Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions, University of Chicago.

One of the men, a soldier disguised as a schoolmaster, made his way to British-controlled Manhattan and began furtively making notes and sketches to bring back to the beleaguered Continental Army general, George Washington. The other man traveled to New York to accept a captain's commission in a loyalist regiment before returning home to recruit others to join British forces. Neither man completed his mission. Both met their deaths at the end of a hangman's rope, one executed as a spy for the American cause and the other as a traitor to it.<br><br>Neither Nathan Hale nor Moses Dunbar deliberately set out to be a revolutionary or a loyalist, yet both suffered the same fate. They died when there was every indication that Britain would win the American Revolution. Had that been the outcome, Dunbar, convicted of treason and since forgotten, might well be celebrated as a martyr. And Hale, caught spying on the British, would likely be remembered as a traitor, rather than a Revolutionary hero. <br><br>In <em>The Martyr and the Traitor,</em> Virginia DeJohn Anderson offers an intertwined narrative of men from very similar backgrounds and reveals how their relationships within their families and communities became politicized as the imperial crisis with Britain erupted. She explores how these men forged their loyalties in perilous times and believed the causes for which they died to be honorable. Through their experiences, The Martyr and the Traitor illuminates the impact of the Revolution on ordinary lives and how the stories of patriots and loyalists were remembered and forgotten after independence.<br></p><p><br><strong>Virginia DeJohn Anderson </strong>is Professor of History at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Which of her subjects, one might ask, was the martyr and which the traitor? Her narrative casts important new light on unfamiliar political uncertainties in revolutionary New England." - Mary Beth Norton, author of <em>In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692</em><p></p><br>"Both Nathan Hale and Moses Dunbar were Connecticut Yankees. Both were hanged as spies. Following them to the gallows, Virginia Anderson gives us a powerful tale about the American Revolution's bitter, tragic conflicts." - Edward Countryman, Southern Methodist University<p></p><br>"No less than others, the American Revolution was not just a matter of declarations and high-mindedness, but a bitter internal conflict that tore apart individuals, families and their communities. Anderson's fine work exposes to view these often hidden realities." - <em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br><p></p><br>"The author asks readers to question their education concerning the Revolutionary War and its black-and-white rendering of patriots as good and loyalists as evil. In the process, Anderson successfully documents not only the injustices done to colonists by the British, but also the mistreatment of loyalists by the Whigs, a subject that is often overlooked... This book will be of great importance to readers interested in the legacy and memory of American conflicts." - <em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"This is a tale of two men, two causes and two tragedies: two Connecticut farm boys who yearned for something better, two young men caught up in the fearsome tumult of revolution, two steadfast soldiers who refused to repent before they hanged. One is well-known: Nathan Hale, the American spy who regretted that he had but one life to lose for his country. The other is Moses Dunbar, a lowly Anglican Loyalist whom most of his countrymen wanted to forget... a moving coming-of-age (and end-of-life) story as well as a military history and a spy thriller." --<em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"This dual biography of a famous patriot and a virtually unknown loyalist demonstrates the perplexing choices many Americans faced during the Revolution...Its real value (there is little available information on the men themselves) is the author's meticulous untangling of the social, educational, cultural, economic, and religious threads that eventually led people with similar backgrounds to choose opposite sides in the conflict.

When the hero, Walter Hartright, on a moonlit night in North London, encounters a solitary, terrified and beautiful woman dressed in white, he feels impelled to solve the mystery of her distress. The intricate plot is peopled with a finely characterised cast, from the peevish invalid Mr Fairlie to the corpulent villain Count Fosco and the enigmatic woman herself.</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Public Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (American Nurses Association)</h2><p>Health care in the U.S. is in the throes of shifting its emphasis from an illness care system to one focused on health promotion and disease prevention.

As these timescales have lengthened however, the interval between the two dates has reduced so much so that it has left us with a serious conundrum: the interval between the formation of the Earth (or at least a surface capable of supporting life) and the appearance of life is simply too short for life to have come into existence from scratch. <p>The key questions thrown up by this problem of timing are addressed for the first time in The Feathered Onion. Is the Earth older than we think? Could life on Earth really have developed incredibly rapidly? Did life originate elsewhere and then find its way to our planet? Clive Trotman explores the science and potential of these theories with explanations of the latest scientific techniques and their implications for our current understanding of where we came from.</p></p><p>Traces of the earliest forms of life on Earth reveal that they were already highly complex, consisting of cells, genes, proteins and an intricate metabolism. Life at the biochemical level was in many ways as complex in those early organisms as it is today, which leaves us with a massive gap in our knowledge about how life got started in a relatively short space of time.&nbsp; We know that evolution takes millions of years to complete even small changes in animals and plants.&nbsp; Can we really accept that transition from simple chemicals to primitive yet complex life forms - and ultimately to humans - occurred in such a short time-span? <p>The key questions thrown up by this problem of timing are addressed in <i>The Feathered Onion.</i> Clive Trotman investigates the origins of life from our first attempts to understand the age of the Earth to the latest scientific techniques and their implications for our current understanding of where we came from.</p>Over the past 150 years the acknowledged dates for the formation of the Earth and the origin of life have been pushed steadily back - further and further into the remote past.&nbsp; As these timescales have lengthened however, the interval between the two dates has diminished to such an extent that we're left with a serious conundrum: The interval between the formation of the Earth (or at least a surface capable of supporting life) and the appearance of life is simply too short for life to have evolved from scratch. <p>Could life on Earth really have developed so rapidly? Is the Earth older than we think? Or did life originate elsewhere and then find its way to our planet? Has it always been a phenomenon of the universe rather than only our unremarkable planet?&nbsp; In this fascinating book Clive Trotman uses the latest scientific research to explore these questions and the origins of life in the universe.</p></p><h2>King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table</h2><p>This work is based on &#34;Morte d&#39; Arthur&#34; written by Sir Thomas Malory. This story, which has so deeply impressed itself upon the hearts and minds of men, centers on the shadowy but heroic figure of Arthur, king of the Britons in the 5th or 6th century. It has flowed over time by being told by various authors, and on this current it carried the elements of all the influences and ideals that were gradually determining the nature and standards of the English-speaking world. Handsomely illustrated.</p><p>Retold out of the old romances, this collection of Arthurian tales endeavors to make each adventure--&#34;The Quest for the Round Table, &#34; &#34;The First Quest of Sir Lancelot, &#34; &#34;How the Holy Grail Came to Camelot, &#34; and so forth--part of a fixed pattern that effectively presents the whole story, as it does in Le Morte D&#39;Arthur, but in a way less intimidating to young readers.

Dave retired after 30 years of teaching writing in college, high school, junior high and grade school. <p> When their son was in the fourth grade, Dave and his wife Lea realized that he was not being given the training they felt he needed and elected to homeschool him in language arts. To prepare him for college writing, they designed a series of lessons, which he completed by the age of twelve. That summer, they enrolled him in freshman English at Lake Michigan College, where he received his first A in college work. He is now a poet and university professor. </p><p> Dave and Lea later turned these lessons into the <i>Writing Strands</i> series of books. While Dave never maintained that the series could create poets for other homeschooling parents, he felt that if children worked successfully through the <i>Writing Strands</i> series of books, they would have the skills needed for the challenge of any writing assignment in their undergraduate college work.</p></p><h2>The Puritan Way of Death: A Study in Religion, Culture, and Social Change (Galaxy Books)</h2><p><em>The Puritan Way of Death</em> is more than a book about Puritans or about death.

In any book on the eye and vision, Young is the London physician who showed how the eye focuses and proposed the three-color theory of vision confirmed only in 1959. In any book on ancient Egypt, Young is credited for his crucial detective work in deciphering the Rosetta Stone. It is hard to grasp how much he knew.<br>Invited to contribute to a new edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Young offered the following subjects: Alphabet, Annuities, Attraction, Capillary Action, Cohesion, Colour, Dew, Egypt, Eye, Focus, Friction, Halo, Hieroglyphic, Hydraulics, Motion, Resistance, Ship, Sound, Strength, Tides, Waves, and anything of a medical nature. He asked that all his contributions be kept anonymous. <br>While not yet thirty he gave a course of lectures at the Royal Institution covering virtually all of known science. But polymathy made him unpopular in the academy. An early attack on his wave theory of light was so scathing that English physicists buried it for nearly two decades until it was rediscovered in France. But slowly, after his death, great scientists recognized his genius.<br>Today, in an age of professional specialization unimaginable in 1800, polymathy still disturbs us. Is this kind of curiosity selfish, even irresponsible?&nbsp; Here is the story of a driven yet modest hero, the last man who knew everything.</p><p><p><b>Andrew Robinson </b>is a King&#x2019;s Scholar of Eton College and holds degrees from Oxford University (in science) and the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. He is the author of more than a dozen books including four biographies: <i>Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity</i>; <i>The Man Who Deciphered Linear B: The Story of Michael Ventris</i>; <i>Satyajit</i> <i>Ray: The Inner Eye</i>; and <i>Rabindranath Tagore: The Myriad-Minded Man</i> (written with Krishna Dutta). Since 1994, he has been the literary editor of <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement </i>in London.</p>Preface<p><b>Preface</b></p><p>Versatile people have always fascinated me as a biographer. Most recently, there was Albert Einstein, who, as everyone knows, fathered diverse new fields of science, but who also influenced some crucial areas of international politics. Before Einstein, Michael Ventris, a professional architect who in his spare time deciphered Linear B, the earliest European writing system, and became revered by archaeologists. And before Ventris, two prodigious Indians, the writer Rabindranath Tagore and the filmmaker Satyajit Ray, both of whom were intensely creative in areas outside literature and cinema. </p><p>But I must admit that Thomas Young (1773-1829), for sheer range of expertise, beats them all. Not only did he make pioneering contributions to physics (the wave theory of light) and engineering (the modulus of elasticity), to physiology (the mechanism of vision) and to Egyptology (the decipherment of the hieroglyphs), but he was also a distinguished physician, a major scholar of ancient Greek, a phenomenal linguist, and an authoritative writer on all manner of other subjects, from carpentry and music to life insurance and ocean tides. In an exhibition on Young arranged by London's Science Museum for his bicentenary in 1973, the organizers went so far as to state: "Young probably had a wider range of creative learning than any other Englishman in history. He made discoveries in nearly every field he studied". </p><p>This makes Young a tough subject for a biographer, and perhaps that is why there has not been a new biography of him for half a century. I have contemplated writing one for over a decade, since first encountering Young while researching a book, <i>The Story of Writing</i>, and I became further committed to the idea while writing another book, <i>Lost Languages</i>, on archaeological decipherment, a few years later. But having thought about the challenge, I decided it would be better to write an introduction to Young for a new audience, rather than attempting a full biography. To cover his work and life in detail and with authority is probably impossible for a single writer. This book therefore dwells only on the highlights of his polymathic career, though it aims to touch on every interesting and enduring aspect of Young.</p><p>I should like to thank the following for their help. Nicholas Wade, professor of visual psychology at Dundee, procured for me a four-volume set of the recent facsimile edition of Young's most famous work, <i>A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts</i>, for which he wrote an introduction. Christina Riggs, curator of Egyptology at the Manchester Museum, advised me on Horapollo's hieroglyphs. David Sprigings, consultant cardiologist at Northampton General Hospital, encouraged me to trace the post-mortem examination of Young to the library of St George's Hospital, London (where Young was a physician), and provided an expert opinion on the cause of his early death. Simon Young, son of the physiologist J. Z. Young, and great-great-great-grandnephew of Thomas Young, kindly gave me permission to reproduce his copy of the portrait of his ancestor painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence. Finally, I am grateful to my publisher, Stephen Morrow, at Pi Press, for getting excited by Young's versatility, too.</p><p><b>London, September 2005</b></p><br><p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Based on in-depth, first-hand experience with hundreds of companies, this book is designed to provide managers with comprehensive guidance through the maze of pricing issues. The authors demonstrate why pricing excellence is critical to corporate success and profitability, then explain state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing and improving your own pricing strategy for any product or service. Their advice is critical for readers who need to develop pricing strategies that work in both good economic times and bad.</p><p>For all the advantages businesses pursue, there is one powerful advantage that is accessible to virtually every business&#x2013;but realized by very few. That advantage is the price advantage. Pricing is far and away the most sensitive profit lever that managers can influence. Very small changes in average price translate into huge changes in operating profit, yet few companies are as disciplined and scientific about pricing as they should be. <p>In the most comprehensive and insightful treatment of pricing management available today, The Price Advantage shows companies how to use pricing excellence to outperform the competition and increase profitability in both good and bad times. Drawing on more than two decades of client success, three preeminent McKinsey &amp; Company experts demonstrate why pricing is critical to bottom-line profitability and explain state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing pricing and building distinctive pricing capability in an organization. Working with colleagues and companies across the globe, they have helped develop leading-edge practical knowledge in pricing for clients in all major industries</p> <p>Written in easy-to-understand language, The Price Advantage serves as a practical pricing guide for the thoughtful general manager who has been tempted by the unrealized promise of improved pricing and, perhaps, even frustrated by attempts to translate pricing theory into bottom-line impact for his or her business. It is intended to provide a logical and structured approach for identifying where the most precious sources of untapped pricing opportunity reside in a business, along with practical, case-illustrated guidance on how to capture that opportunity.</p> <p>With emphasis on translating pricing theory into real improvements and bottom-line performance, The Price Advantage is designed to give today&#x2019;s CEOs and business managers a competitive advantage in any economy.</p>The Price Advantage, written by three preeminent experts at McKinsey &amp; Company, is the most pragmatic and insightful book on pricing available. Based on in-depth, firsthand experience with hundreds of companies, as well as significant investments in basic pricing research, this book is designed to be a comprehensive guide for managers through the maze of pricing issues. The authors examine state-of-the-art approaches for analyzing and improving pricing performance, demonstrate those approaches with real case studies, and draw a pricing excellence blueprint for companies to follow. In good economic times or bad, achieving the price advantage is critical to corporate performance and profitability.</p><h2>Sustainable Building Systems and Construction for Designers</h2><p><p>This text views building construction and its systems through the lens of sustainability, providing an integrated approach to the principles of sustainable design as the way a building is created.

If you are a systems analyst or requirements engineer it will provide an essential, practical guide from the task of identifying the problem to making the descriptions needed to resolve it.<br>It will help you: decompose complex problems into simpler subproblems and see how the subproblems fit together; and build up a repertoire of simple, clear and easily applicable problem classes which you can access and reuse, drawing on the experience associated with each class.<br>Features: numerous real-world example problems are analyzed, giving you insight into how to recognize and structure your own problems in practice; a mixture of large and small problems is presented, showing the stripped down essence of problem classes and discussing different aspects of each problem; problem frames are independent of any particular development method, so they can be easily applied in your own situation; and appendices summarizing the descriptive languages and notations; plus a glossary of terminology.</p><p>Software development problems<br> The central goal in a software development problem is to create the software for a computer system that will serve some useful purpose in the world. This book is about analysing and structuring problems of this kind.<br> These problems are found in many different contexts and forms. If you are doing software development you might be building a system to act as a repository and access mechanism for information about bank accounts and loans. You might be developing a telephone exchange to switch local calls. You might be creating a tool for writing and editing texts and diagrams; or a control device to maintain cruising speed in a car; or a compiling machine to transform Java programs into bytecode. Almost any part of the human and physical world can furnish the raw material and the context for a software development problem.<br> Because computers can serve so many purposes, and play the central role in solving so many different kinds of problem, the practice of software development is less specialised than the established engineering disciplines. For the individual developer, and the individual development project, there's a lot more variety. That's why you should usually start by describing and structuring your problem in a way that's rarely necessary in other engineering disciplines, where the diversity of problems to be solved is much smaller. The automobile engineer designing a sports car does not need to ask whether the car must be capable of carrying 15 people, travelling underwater, carrying a ten-ton load, or moving backwards at 100mph. The phrase 'sports car' specifies both the problem and its acceptable solutions closely enough to answer those questions and many others. <br> But as a software developer you are rarely solving an immediately recognisable and well understood problem. Usually, you must begin by asking: What kind of problem is this? What, exactly, is the problem about? What purpose is being served in the world? What behaviour and properties must the computer have to achieve that purpose? Often, software development seems to start at square one. <br> <br> Problem frames<br> When you analyse a problem you see what kind of problem it is, and identify the concerns and difficulties you will have to deal with to solve it. The concerns in a Java compiler will be very different from the concerns in a car braking system. You have different things to think about. Different kinds of descriptions must be made, and fitted together into differently shaped arguments. Problem analysis takes you from the level of identifying the problem to the level of making the descriptions needed to solve it.<br> But most realistic problems are too big and complex to handle in just two levels like this. Another level is needed: structuring the problem as a collection of interacting subproblems. If your structuring is successful, the subproblems will be smaller and simpler than the problem you started with, and their interactions will be clear and understandable. Then you can analyse each subproblem separately, as a simple problem on its own, and make the descriptions it needs. <br> The central idea of this book is to use problem frames in problem analysis and structure. They help you by defining different simple problem classes. When you structure a larger, realistic problem, you choose the subproblems so that each one is a problem of the simple kind defined by some problem frame. Then, when you analyse the subproblem, you see what concerns it raises according to the problem frame that fits it. The frame shows you what you must do to solve it.<br> A problem frame defines the shape of a problem by capturing the characteristics and interconnections of the parts of the world it is concerned with, and the concerns and difficulties that are likely to arise. So problem frames help you to focus on the problem, instead of drifting into inventing solutions. They do this by emphasising the world outside the computer, the effects that are required there, and the relationships among things and events of the world by which your customer will ultimately judge whether those effects have been achieved.<br> Problem frames share much of the spirit of design patterns. Design patterns look inwards towards the computer and its software, while problem frames look outwards to the world where the problem is found. But they both identify and describe recurring situations. They provide a taxonomy within which each increment of experience and knowledge you acquire can be assigned to its proper place in a larger scheme, and can be shared and accessed more effectively. So just as in object-oriented design a familiarity with design patterns allows you to say 'we need an instance of the decorator pattern here', so in problem decomposition a familiarity with problem frames allows you to say 'this part of the problem is a workpieces problem'. Having identified a part of a problem with a recognised problem frame, you can draw on experience associated with the frame. <br> The problem frame idea was first published in book form in my book Software Requirements &amp; Specifications, where it was sketched in outline as one of a small number of related topics. This book puts more flesh on that skeleton. A number of elementary and composite problem frames are discussed and illustrated, along with a number of flavours and variants, and some of the concerns they raise are examined. The use of problem frames in decomposing realistic problems into subproblems is also explored and illustrated.<br> <br> A focused view<br> Some people think that this notion of software development problems derives from a perspective that is too sharply focused and too narrow. They point out that computer systems, and the process of software development itself, almost always exist in a complex and fluid social, political, ethical and economic environment. When you are discovering the requirements for a system you are likely to be engaged in a process of social negotiation among conflicting groups of stakeholders; when you make a decision about system functionality you may be implicitly favouring one group over another; when you enlarge the system scope you are often giving political power to one group at the expense of another; when you analyse the purposes to be served by the system you are exploring its economic and organisational consequences. <br> So, from this point of view, the major concerns in software development are social and political, organisational and economic. Thinking in terms of problems doesn't do justice to these concerns. It's true that these concerns are important in many developments, but nonetheless we are going to ignore them in this book. We are not going to discuss how to elicit requirements, how to make the business case, how to manage the project, facilitate meetings, or negotiate compromise. We will ignore these things, not because they are unimportant but simply because they are not the subject matter of this book. If you want to understand anything, you mustn't try to understand everything. <br> Instead, we are going to try to understand some more sharply focused ideas in problem structure and analysis in the context of software development. Our chief topics will be the material, observable effects that the system should bring about in the world, the computer behaviour that will achieve those effects, and the connection between them. In short, the topics that are often called functional requirements, software specifications, and the path by which you get from one to the other.<br> <br> Focusing on problems<br> It is not easy to focus on problems in software development. One reason is that they have some precise and some imprecise aspects, all competing for your attention. Like Odysseus on his ship coming home from Troy, you are sailing between Scylla and Charybdis, and must try to steer a middle course. <br> If you are attracted by the arguments of the people who regard our view of problems as far too formal and narrow, you may be dragged off to the right, into the world of purely human problems - the imprecise world of sociology and ethnography, where nothing is ever completely certain or completely exact. That's an important world, but it neglects the software and its development.<br> However, if you find that problems are less exciting than their software solutions, you are more likely to veer off to the left, towards the much more precise world of programming - of variables and methods and object classes, where boolean values are always either True or False, and never anything in between. Progamming is also important, but it won't be useful if no one has analysed the problem and worked out what the programs must do. <br> In the problems discussed in this book, there are plenty of precise and plenty of imprecise ingredients. We will try to do justice to both, to steer the proper course for understanding and analysing problems.<br> <br> Formality and informality<br> If you steer the proper course between Scylla and Charybdis, and succeed in focusin<p><i>�Understanding and using problem frames will likely become an essential skill of all good software system designers.

Written by the foremost black woman activist of the nineteenth century, the novel sheds light on the movements for abolition, public education, and voting rights through a compelling narrative. </p> <p>This edition engages the latest research on Harper&#x2019;s life and work and offers ways to teach these major moments in United States history by centering the experiences of African Americans. The appendices provide primary documents that help readers do what they are seldom encouraged to do: consider the experiences and perspectives of people who are not white. The Introduction traces Harper&#x2019;s biography and the changing critical perspectives on the novel. </p></p><p><p><strong>Koritha Mitchell</strong> is Associate Professor of English at Ohio State University. </p><p>&#x201c;Edited by one of the finest scholars of American literature, this Broadview edition of the much beloved, popular nineteenth-century classic <em>Iola Leroy</em> commands new attention and demonstrates fresh relevance. Koritha Mitchell elegantly argues for the merits of this early novel as an African American community text, based on its aesthetic qualities, the political currents that shaped it, and the material realities of its production, circulation, and readership. Appendices of thoughtfully curated secondary sources that privilege the firsthand testimonies of early African Americans about emancipatory, intellectual, social, and cultural matters, and that feature more creative and critical selections by Harper, bring distinction to this teachable, accessible edition. If one wishes to understand how the aftermath of enslavement has influenced and continues to shape the African American literary tradition and national conversations among and about African Americans, the Broadview edition of<em> Iola Leroy</em> is a necessary place to begin.&#x201d; &#x2015; Barbara McCaskill, University of Georgia </p> <p>&#x201c;Koritha Mitchell gives us the definitive edition of <em>Iola Leroy</em>, a novel that reflects the mature insight and creative prowess of teacher, activist, and writer Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. Readers are guided through this compelling saga of post&#x2013;Civil War race, gender, class, and politics by Mitchell&#x2019;s patient, expert hand. Her original interpretations are enriched by careful attention to the important debates that have always surrounded Harper&#x2019;s work. Return to this edition again and again to discover the many meanings embedded in<em> Iola Leroy</em> and in Harper&#x2019;s gifted prose.&#x201d; &#x2015; Martha S. Jones, Johns Hopkins University </p> <p>&#x201c;Koritha Mitchell&#x2019;s Broadview Press edition is a triumph and a gift to the field. Her critical work in this volume ensures that generations of readers will recognize the novel as a touchstone in their literary educations and imaginations.... Like all the best critical and cultural editions, it serves as a model for the kind of scholarship we want to write and help our students to write. The contextual materials that bookend Mitchell&#x2019;s introduction and the novel itself serve not only as citations for her critical throughlines but also as an invitation to readers to be more aware of how they read texts through one another. Mitchell has produced an unparalleled resource that positions Iola Leroy as a definitive text, and her editorial provocation urges us to keep reading, rereading, and reconsidering this novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mollie Barnes, <em>Legacy</em> </p> <p>&#x201c;Koritha Mitchell&#x2019;s new cultural edition of Harper&#x2019;s fourth novel, <em>Iola Leroy; Or, Shadows of Uplift</em> (first published in 1892), provides a compelling new entry in this tradition and an indispensable resource for those who assign Harper regularly or who have hesitated to teach <em>Iola</em> out of concern for the syllabus space required to get students up to speed on its historical and cultural contexts. Mitchell&#x2019;s introduction on its own is worth the price of admission, as it synthesizes the latest work in Harper studies and situates <em>Iola</em> within it. ... In addition to her biographical and bibliographic work, Mitchell offers a fresh take on <em>Iola</em>&#x2019;s form and politics. <em>Iola</em>, Mitchell posits, &#x2018;exemplifies the dynamism and complexity of ... &#x201c;community conversation&#x201d; ... the broad, dynamic discussions among African Americans about the countless issues affecting community members&#x2019; life chances and well-being&#x2019; (30). Throughout, Mitchell foregrounds Harper&#x2019;s abiding faith in black communities and incisive critiques of white supremacy. </p> <p>... </p> <p>&#x201c;Mitchell&#x2019;s critical apparatus speaks to previous scholars&#x2019; monumental efforts to make Harper studies a robust field. It speaks also to an ethics of citation that should be emulated. This cultural edition offers the nineteenth century in a box, robust enough to anchor a course in which <em>Iola</em> represents either the &#x2018;early&#x2019; or &#x2018;late&#x2019; text. Mitchell&#x2019;s attention to the intersections of form, literary history, and politics make it an ideal edition for graduate seminars, exam lists, and research, as well.&#x201d; &#x2015; Derrick R.

It focuses on how charismatic, authoritarian leaders control their followers&#x2019; attachment relationships via manipulative social structures and ideologies so that, emotionally and cognitively isolated, they become unable to act in their own survival interests. Using the evolutionary theory of attachment to demonstrate the psychological impact of these environments, and incorporating the latest neuroscientific findings, Stein illustrates how the combined dynamic of terror and &#x2018;love&#x2019; works to break down people&#x2019;s ability to think and behave rationally. From small local cults to global players like ISIS and North Korea, the impact of these movements is widespread and growing.</p> <p></p> <p>This important book offers clarity and a unique perspective on the dynamics of these systems of control, and concludes with guidance to foster greater awareness and prevention. It will be essential reading for mental health professionals in the field, as well as policy makers, legal professionals,&nbsp;cult survivors, and their families, as well as anyone with an interest in these disturbing groups. Students of social and developmental psychology will also find it fascinating. </p></p><p><p><strong>Alexandra Stein</strong> is a social psychologist who lectures and writes on cults and totalitarianism.

But what makes <i>The Literature of the American South</i> especially noteworthy is the juxtaposition of black and white writers, whose texts make clear both divisions and commonalities, and places the literary history of the region in a new light. Excerpts from Thomas Jefferson's <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> are followed by black surveyor and inventor Benjamin Banneker's letter to Jefferson, which points out the contradiction between Jefferson owning slaves and the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. Also included is an illuminating counterpoint between the excerpt from former slave Harriet Ann Jacobs's autobiography, and the diary of plantation mistress Mary Boykin Chesnut.

He reveals the maneuvering of colonial political leaders such as Governor Francis Bernard, Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson, and James Otis Jr. as they responded to London's new policies, and he evokes the outrage many Bostonians felt towards Parliament and its local representatives. <br><br>Archer captures the popular mobilization under the leadership of John Hancock and Samuel Adams that met the oppressive imperial measures--most notably the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act--with demonstrations, Liberty Trees, violence, and non-importation agreements. When the British government decided to garrison Boston with troops, it posed a shocking challenge to the people of Massachusetts. The city was flooded with troops; almost immediately, tempers flared and violent conflicts broke out. Archer's vivid tale culminates in the swirling tragedy of the Boston Massacre and its aftermath, including the trial and exoneration of the British troops involved. <br><br>A thrilling and original work of history, <em>As If an Enemy's Country</em> tells the riveting story of what made the Boston townspeople, and with them other colonists, turn toward revolution.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Archer</strong> is Professor of History Emeritus at Whittier College. He is the author of <em>Fissures in the Rock: New England in the Seventeenth Century</em>.<br><br>"Richard Archer's book is a remarkably fresh examination of the story of the British occupation of Boston in the years before the Revolution. Its close attention to the social and economic context of the dramatic events of those years gives the book much of its richness; and its telling of the events themselves, ending with a splendid account of the Boston Massacre, is accomplished with great clarity, detail, and verve. Altogether it is a fascinating book."--Robert Middlekauff, author of <em>The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789</em><p></p><br>"In ways that are familiar today when American forces occupy faraway lands, the British military occupation of Boston in October 1768 deeply radicalized the town's citizens. In this crisply written account, Richard Archer walks the reader through Boston's crooked streets and along the waterfront with such narrative verve that we can almost see, hear, and feel the seething tension that grew for seventeen months before the Boston Massacre. With his careful research and nose for telling detail, Archer allows us to understand why Boston led the colonies into independence."--Gary B. Nash, author of <em>The Unknown American Revolution: The Unruly Birth of Democracy and the Struggle to Create America</em><p></p><br><em>"As If An Enemy's Country</em> provides a long-overdue explanation of how the American Revolution began. Richard Archer has connected the dots in this extraordinarily well-written, concise, thorough and engaging account of the British occupation of Boston after 1768. Archer shows how the relationships between the Boston mob and the provincial elite, among merchants, trade, and religion in Boston's unique political culture turned rebellion into Revolution. An essential book--a fascinating story well-told."--Robert Allison, author of <em>A Short History of Boston</em><p></p><br>"Archer utilizes a wealth of primary sources, from diaries to depositions, to provide an edifying account of the 17-month British occupation of Boston from October 1768 to the winter of 1770. ... Beginning with British attempts to consolidate the empire and gain revenue from the Colonies in the form of innovative taxes and concluding with a perceptive analysis of the Boston Massacre, Archer astutely delves into the milieu of a Colonial city alive with mobs, patriots, and the omnipresent British army. The uniqueness of Archer's superbly crafted tale lies in his discussion of how the politics of nonimportation polarized the elite of Boston society on the eve of revolution. <strong>VERDICT</strong> Combining engaging prose and a wealth of interesting characters, Archer has provided students and general enthusiasts alike with a concise, appealing work of first-rate scholarship."--<em>Library Journal</em>, starred review <br><p></p><br>"Archer goes into [...] detail, drawing good portraits of several principals, including John Hancock and cousins John and Sam Adams."--<em>Tampa Tribune</em> <br><p></p><br>"A gripping narrative of the occupation of Boston."--LAmag.com, The Reading List<p></p><br>"[T]his is a serious historical analysis rich in details, primary sources, and the minutiae that make up our history.

Despite the importance of the job, there is currently no book specifically designed as a comprehensive reference manual for the working BA. The Business Analyst&#39;s Handbook solves this problem by providing a useful compendium of tools, tables, lists, and templates that BAs can use on-the-job to carry out their tasks. For example, you might be preparing for an interview session and use the book&#39;s checklist of interviewees to verify whether there is appropriate coverage of business stakeholders. Or you might be asked to review some diagrams and refer to the Glossaries of Symbols (organized by diagram type) for guidance. Or you may be asked to prepare textual requirements documentation and refer to the Business Requirement template for a list of artifacts and table of contents.

The coverage is extremely wide, including such important areas as linear algebra, group theory, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, the theory of functions of real and complex variables, and related subjects. . . . What makes these volumes so readable as compared with usual mathematics textbooks is the emphasis here upon basic concepts and results rather than upon the intricate and wearying proofs that make such demands in conventional textbooks and courses. There are proofs in these volumes, but usually they are presented only for the most important results, and even then to emphasize key areas and to illustrate the kind of methodology employed. . . .

She has to use standard units like inches and nonstandard units like paper clips to find out height, width, length, weight, volume, temperature, and time. Lisa decides to measure her dog, Penny, and finds out ... </p><p>Penny's nose = 1 inch long <br>Penny's tail = 1 dog biscuit long<br>Penny's paw print = 3 centimeters wide </p><p>... and that's only the beginning! Lisa learns a lot about her dog and about measuring, and even has fun doing it.</p><p>This clear and engaging concept book, delivered with a sense of humor, is certain to win over the most reluctant mathematician.</p></p><p>Loreen Leedy writes and illustrates books in her studio in central Florida. When not writing, drawing, or painting on her computer, she's exercising, eating out, or going to the movies with her husband Andy. Her other books include the following:<i></i><ul><li><i>Mapping Penny's World</i></li><li><i>It's Probably Penny</i></li><li><i>My Teacher Is a Dinosaur</i></li><li><i>The Shocking Truth about Energy</i></li><li><i>Crazy Like a Fox: A Simile Story</i></li><li><i>Missing Math: A Number Mystery</i></li><li><i>Fraction Action</i></li><li><i>There's a Frog in My Throat: 440 Animal Sayings a Little Bird Told Me</i></li></ul>Her web site is LoreenLeedy.com.Gr. 2^-4. With several successful informational picture books already to her credit, including <i>Mission Addition</i> and <i>Postcards from Pluto</i> (1993), Leedy turns her attention to a subject children frequently have difficulty understanding: measurement. In this creative introduction, she takes a look at various kinds of measurement (height, weight, volume, even time and temperature) and units of measure, presenting them as part of a scenario in which a young girl, Lisa, uses her dog, Penny, to help her complete her measuring assignment for class. Crisp, carefully captioned pictures, including many easy-to-grasp visual comparisons, spread across large-size pages, making the book easy to use with a small group. Leedy goes into the most detail about height and length, demonstrating, in the illustrations and through a chart, the relationship between inches, feet, and yards. She's more general with other measures, sticking largely to introducing units of measurement (for example, tablespoon, teaspoon, second, minute), and leaving the rest up to grown-ups to explain. One of the best parts of the book is her treatment of nonstandard units, which is both fun and informative: Penny's tail is one dog biscuit long, but it takes 10 biscuits to measure the tail of a greyhound. Leedy also introduces children to the more abstract concept of value: "We decided Penny is kind of expensive . . . but she's worth it," which adults can explain further in follow-up discussions. The book is perfect for classroom use, but it's also not much of a stretch to imagine children at home whipping out measuring devices and cornering their pets. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Spanish Vocabulary (Barron&#39;s Vocabulary Series)</h2><p>More than 5,000 words and expressions in this English-Spanish handbook include an updated and enlarged list of words dealing with communications, electronics, and technology.

Drawing on unpublished eyewitness accounts by individuals from all ranks--not only from Britain, Australia and New Zealand, but from Turkey and France as well--Peter Hart weaves first-hand stories into a vivid narrative of the battle and its aftermath. Hart, a historian with the Imperial War Museum and a battlefield tour guide at Gallipoli, provides a vivid, boots-on-the-ground account that brilliantly evokes the confusion of war, the horrors of combat, and the grim courage of the soldiers. He provides an astute, unflinching assessment of the leaders as well. He shows that the British invasion was doomed from the start, but he places particular blame on General Sir Ian Hamilton, whose misplaced optimism, over-complicated plans, and unwillingness to recognize the gravity of the situation essentially turned likely failure into complete disaster. <br><br> Capturing the sheer drama and bravery of the ferocious fighting, the chivalry demonstrated by individuals on both sides amid merciless wholesale slaughter, and the futility of the cause for which ordinary men fought with extraordinary courage and endurance--<em>Gallipoli</em> is a riveting account of a battle that continues to fascinate us close to a hundred years after the event.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Hart</strong> is Oral Historian of the Imperial War Museum and works as battlefield tour guide at Gallipoli. He is author of <em>The Somme: The Darkest Hour on the Western Front </em>and <em>1918: A Very British Victory</em><br><br>"[Peter Hart] has skillfully blended his analysis of the campaign with scores of personal accounts from both sides that fought at Gallipoli, and there are numerous maps to help readers better understand the progress of the fighting. Those who are interested in the First World War will find this a most compelling book, as we seek 'to resolve the conundrum of how somthing so stupid, so doomed from the outset, can remain so utterly fascinating.'" --<em>Army History</em><p></p><br>"<em>Gallipoli</em> is replete with lengthy and compelling quotations by Australian, British, French and Turkish soldiers, most never before published. Hart's intimate familiarity with the battlefield, where he leads regular tours, adds a level of understanding absent from other books. Overall, <em>Gallipoli</em> is an important contribution to the growing literature on this epic and tragic campaign." --Edward G. Lengel, <em>Military History</em> <br><p></p><br>"The human element still defines this compelling account of an operation Hart dismisses as a 'lunacy that never could have succeeded,' driven by wishful thinking as opposed to the professional analysis of ends and means...He is at his best, however, in explaining and presenting the 'near-superhuman courage and endurance' of the combatants. That remains Gallipoli's enduring appeal." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"An important reevaluation, largely from the Allied point of view. An excellent summary of an iconic campaign, offering many lessons for war planners." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"HERE is a marvellous, ghastly book...What makes Mr Hart's version so bracing is his method. He is a specialist in oral history at London's Imperial War Museum, and this book, like others he has written or co-written, gains richness and texture from the use of first-hand testimony." --<em>The</em> <em>Economist</em><p></p><br>"This thorough updating of one of WWI's great 'might have beens' makes a good acquistion as we approach the centennial of the battle." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Macleod's <em>Gallipoli</em> is a valuable contribution to the sea of Gallipoli scholarship available.

Our imagination is likely to run to something like a vague fuzzy cloud. Or perhaps we think of an invisible, impersonal force. No wonder the Holy Spirit is often called &#34;it.&#34; While Christians affirm that the Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, we struggle to think of him as a person at all. The Bible is clear that the Holy Spirit is a person. But how can human beings understand who he is? Scripture helps us by giving us strong word pictures of the Spirit as wind, fire, a counselor, anointing oil and more. As you go through these eight Bible studies by Dale and Sandy Larsen, you will find that your mental picture of the Spirit comes into focus. And even better, you will find that you can have a real relationship with the third person of the Trinity as you experience the power, comfort and gifts that flow out from the Spirit.</p><p>Dale Larsen is a writer living in Rochester, Minnesota. He and his wife, Sandy, have written more than thirty books and Bible studies together including <em>Living Your Legacy</em> and more than ten LifeGuide� Bible studies.

In a brief career, cut short by her death from an embolism at the age of thirty-one, shortly after she gave birth to a child, Modersohn-Becker trained in Germany, traveled often to Paris, developed close friendships with the sculptor Clara Westhoff and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and became one of her generation's preeminent artists, helping introduce modernity to the twentieth century alongside such other painters as Picasso and Matisse.</p><p>Marie Darrieussecq's triumphant and illuminating biography at once revives Modersohn-Becker's reputation as a significant figure in modernism and sheds light on the extreme difficulty women have faced in attaining recognition and establishing artistic careers.</p></p><p>Marie Darrieussecq published her first novel, <i>Pig Tales</i>, in 1996 at the age of twenty-seven, and it became an overnight sensation and bestseller, selling more than 300,000 copies and translated into more than thirty languages. <i>The New Yorker</i> described her as France's &#x201c;best young novelist,&#x201d; and she is recognized as one of the leading voices of French contemporary literature. Her novel Men was awarded the Prix M�dicis and the Prix des Prix in 2013.<p>Best Book on Art 2016</p>&#x2015;<i>Lire magazine</i><br><br><p>A biography full of life force, drafted in the present with grace... Dazzling!</p>&#x2015;<i>Elle</i><br><br><p>A magnetic portrait of a woman, taking shape through the seemingly simple, but always so beautiful, writing of Marie Darrieussecq.</p>&#x2015;<i>Vogue</i><br><br><p>Between the lines, this very beautiful text is read as a feminist manifesto, that constantly questions the place for women in art.</p>&#x2015;<i>Les Inrockuptibles</i><br><br><p>Darrieussecq's writing is poetic and stylized; the tableau unfolds sometimes in one-sentence paragraphs and one-word sentences, and always in the present tense. Clearly written for a broad audience, this book will renew appreciation for a deserving artist who's too often reduced to a mere passing mention in art-history textbooks.</p>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><p><i>Being Here is Everything</i> should be read less as a definitive biography than as a tender, interpretative meditation by Darrieussecq. Through her interpretive paraphrasing of the artist's words, her textual narration of the paintings, and her omission of any visual reproductions of them (as well as of most of their titles), Darrieussecq writes a specific version of Modersohn-Becker's life. Though not a book of rigorous scholarship, she nonetheless makes a compelling and lyrical case for resuscitating Modersohn-Becker's reputation, and for exposing her paintings to a wider audience. As at long last we begin to color in the annals of art history with artists who once sat outside the traditional canon, the tapestry becomes all the more vivid with the inclusion of Modersohn-Becker's work.</p>&#x2015;<i>Brooklyn Rail</i><br><br><p>Darrieussecq writes about her subject with a vibrant, urgent present tense-ness, as though Becker herself is unfolding before us. In prose propelled by temperamental rhythms&#x2015;some paragraphs are half a page long, while others are but a single sentence&#x2015;Darrieussecq composes a flickering tale that accounts for the artist's life, for the odd space of grief she feels for the artist she never knew but loves, and for the art Becker might have made.</p>&#x2015;<i>4Columns</i><br><br><p>In Darrieussecq's hands, Modersohn-Becker's story is both individual and exemplary: a frightening, energising fable that weirdly resembles a 19th-century version of Viv Albertine's punk memoir <i>Clothes, Clothes, Clothes, Music, Music, Music, Boys, Boys, Boys</i>, with Sid Vicious recast as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Paula Becker began to draw seriously at the age of 16.</p>&#x2015;<b>Olivia Laing</b>, <i>The Guardian</i></p><h2>Affective Publics: Sentiment, Technology, and Politics (Oxford Studies in Digital Politics)</h2><p>Over the past few decades, we have witnessed the growth of movements using digital means to connect with broader interest groups and express their points of view. These movements emerge out of distinct contexts and yield different outcomes, but tend to share one thing in common: online and offline solidarity shaped around the public display of emotion. Social media facilitate feelings of engagement, in ways that frequently make people feel re-energized about politics. In doing so, media do not make or break revolutions but they do lend emerging, storytelling publics their own means for feeling their way into events, frequently by making those involved a part of the developing story. Technologies network us but it is our stories that connect us to each other, making us feel close to some and distancing us from others. <br><br><em>Affective Publics </em>explores how storytelling practices facilitate engagement among movements tuning into a current issue or event by employing three case studies: Arab Spring movements, various iterations of Occupy, and everyday casual political expressions as traced through the archives of trending topics on Twitter. It traces how affective publics materialize and disband around connective conduits of sentiment every day and find their voice through the soft structures of feeling sustained by societies. Using original quantitative and qualitative data, <em>Affective Publics</em> demonstrates, in this groundbreaking analysis, that it is through these soft structures that affective publics connect, disrupt, and feel their way into everyday politics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Zizi Papacharissi</strong> is professor and head of the Communication Department at the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Zizi Papacharissi brings enormous insight and much needed clarity to current debates about the role of social media in political life. Rejecting binaries which ascribe social movements to Twitter or Facebook or that dismiss all forms of online participation as 'Slacktivism,' she instead acknowledges the ways that social media has provided opportunities for new forms of expression and affiliation, new 'structures of feeling' that can in the right circumstances help to inspire and expand political movements. Her approach mixes theoretical sophistication with empirical rigor as it forces us to rethink what we thought we knew about the Egyptian Revolution and the Occupy movement." <br> --Henry Jenkins, co-author of <em>Spreadable Media: Creating Meaning and Value in a Networked Culture</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Affective Publics</em> transcends the already stale debate between those who see social media as effecting political change and those who castigate it for irrelevant chatter. Instead, in an original move, carefully argued and empirically grounded, Papacharissi shows us how social media facilitate emotionally resonant and collaboratively constructed narratives which, in turn, support civically significant 'soft structures of engagement'." --Sonia Livingstone, co-author of <em>Media Consumption</em> and <em>Public Engagement</em> <br><p></p><br>"A compelling and necessary read. Papacharissi shows how fact, opinion and feeling are threaded together on social platforms to create affective publics.

NRSV translation.</p><p>The Renovar� Spiritual Formation Study Bible offers a new way for discovering the full riches of the Scriptures. As bestselling author and the project&#x2019;s editor, Richard Foster explains, &#x201c;When I first began writing about spiritual formation, the soul hunger in people was obvious and the resources meager. Since then, a publishing avalanche has occurred on the subject--some helpful, some less than helpful. But there has remained a huge gap; a gap that if not filled will seriously undermine all the gains that have been made. The gap I refer to is a resource for approaching the Bible through the lens of Christian spiritual formation.&#x201d;<br> <br> The Word of God is not merely a text to be mastered but a lifestyle to pursue. This unique Bible, spearheaded by bestselling authors Foster (Celebration of Discipline) and Dallas Willard (The Divine Conspiracy), integrates the spiritual disciplines into the Christian life by showing how they are central to the Bible&#x2019;s teachings and stories. The desperate need today is for a richer, fuller understanding of the relevance of Scripture for daily living. The Renovar� Spiritual Formation Study Bible focuses on illuminating issues of spiritual formation throughout the Scriptures, providing a unique window into how we can become more intimate with God. More substantial than a devotional Bible, yet deeper than a study Bible, the Renovar� Spiritual Formation Study Bible is poised to redefine what the Bible can mean for Christian discipleship.<br> <br> This unique study Bible will include several distinctive features:<br> <br> �An introductory essay explaining the paradigm of &#x201c;The With-God Life,&#x201d; which views the whole of Scripture as the unfolding story of God&#x2019;s plan for how we can have an intimate love relationship with our Creator.<br> �A series of fifteen &#x201c;With God&#x201d; essays sprinkled throughout the Bible laying out the progression of the biblical story of how God has, at each stage in history, been forming a people who can freely love both God and others.<br> �Introduction and notes for each book of the Bible, explaining not only the historical and theological background, but also highlighting the main themes for spiritual formation.<br> �Spiritual exercises for helping readers take the next step in incorporating what they encounter in God&#x2019;s living Word.<br> �Profiles of key biblical characters emphasizing how they practiced and modeled spiritual disciplines and the &#x201c;With-God life.&#x201d;<br> �A &#x201c;Spiritual Disciplines Index&#x201d; that provides a glossary and Bible references for each spiritual discipline and key themes of spiritual formation.<br> <br> RENOVAR� is an intrachurch movement committed to the renewal of the Church in all her multifaceted expressions.Renovar� (from the Latin, meaning &#34;to renew&#34;) is an infra-church movement committed to the renewal of the Church of Jesus Christ in all her multifaceted expressions.

De Koven's classic treatise on how human beings play together, first published in 1978, investigates many issues newly resonant in the era of video and computer games, including social gameplay and player modification. The digital game industry, now moving beyond its emphasis on graphic techniques to focus on player interaction, has much to learn from <i>The Well-Played Game</i>.</p><p>De Koven explains that when players congratulate each other on a &#x201c;well-played&#x201d; game, they are expressing a unique and profound synthesis that combines the concepts of play (with its associations of playfulness and fun) and game (with its associations of rule-following). This, he tells us, yields a larger concept: the experience and expression of excellence. De Koven&#x2015;affectionately and appreciatively hailed by Eric Zimmerman as &#x201c;our shaman of play&#x201d;&#x2015;explores the experience of a well-played game, how we share it, and how we can experience it again; issues of cheating, fairness, keeping score, changing old games (why not change the rules in pursuit of new ways to play?), and making up new games; playing for keeps; and winning. His book belongs on the bookshelves of players who want to find a game in which they can play well, who are looking for others with whom they can play well, and who have discovered the relationship between the well-played game and the well-lived life.</p></p><p>Bernard De Koven was a game designer and theorist of fun. He was a codirector of the New Games Foundation and a founder of the Games Preserve. He is the author of <i>Junkyard Sports </i>and the creator of the website deepfun.com.<p>...this book is a must-read for game designers and game players who may wish to tweak the games they play to make playing more rewarding. I would go even further. Because it is so delightful to read, I recommend it to anyone who likes a thought-provoking, intellectual journal. The writing style is deceptively simple. As you read, you wonder to yourself, 'Can it really be this easy?' But don't kid yourself; this is a book that can be read again and again for new insights each time.</p>&#x2015;<i>Computing Reviews</i><br><br><p>This book is important. If you have not read it, read it. If you already have, browse it and you will almost certainly find small details and aspects of play and games that you already knew but failed to take into account. And, more importantly, please rewrite this book in a different tone, in a different format, make YouTube videos about some of its ideas, create web comics about them, share the stories with your students, use its anecdotes in your own work. That is the way that classics are supposed to be dealt with.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gonzalo Frasca</b>, <i>Game Studies</i></p><h2>Irrational Exuberance: Second Edition</h2><p><p>This first edition of this book was a broad study, drawing on a wide range of published research and historical evidence, of the enormous stock market boom that started around 1982 and picked up incredible speed after 1995. Although it took as its specific starting point this ongoing boom, it placed it in the context of stock market booms generally, and it also made concrete suggestions regarding policy changes that should be initiated in response to this and other such booms. The book argued that the boom represents a speculative bubble, not grounded in sensible economic fundamentals. Part one of the book considered structural factors behind the boom. A list of twelve precipitating factors that appear to be its ultimate causes was given. Amplification mechanisms, naturally-occurring Ponzi processes, that enlarge the effects of these precipitating factors, were described. Part Two discussed cultural factors, the effects of the news media, and of "new era" economic thinking. Part Three discussed psychological factors, psychological anchors for the market and herd behavior. Part Four discussed attempts to rationalize exuberance: efficient markets theory and theories that investors are learning. Part Five presented policy options and actions that should be taken.</p><p> The second edition, 2005, added an analysis of the real estate bubble as similar to the stock market bubble that preceded it, and warned that "Significant further rises in these markets could lead, eventually, to even more significant declines. The bad outcome could be that eventual declines would result in a substantial increase in the rate of personal bankruptcies, which could lead to a secondary string of bankruptcies of financial institutions as well. Another long-run consequence could be a decline in consumer and business confidence, and another, possibly worldwide, recession." Thus, the second edition of this book was among the first to warn of the global financial crisis that began with the subprime mortgage debacle in 2007.</p></p><p>Sequels often disappoint when compared to their predecessors, but author Robert Shiller has proved the exception to the rule with his second edition of <i>Irrational Exuberance</i>. When the original book released in 2000, Shiller's prescient analysis of bubble-like market behavior provided perspective on the painful meltdown of stock-price valuations that subsequently occurred. Five years later, the Yale professor's bearish predictions about real-estate valuations are enough to give any savvy investor or homebuyer pause.<p> Shiller is one of several well-known economists and pundits who've begun a running dialogue in the last few years around the drawbacks of unchecked free markets. Few writers, though, dissect the phenomenon of bubble behavior as clearly and thoroughly as Shiller does. As with the first edition of his book, Shiller begins this one with reams of quantitative data around the late 1990s stock-market runup. This new edition adds data on real-estate price trends in the early 2000s, and points out the striking parallels between the earlier stock-market boom and bust, and current trends with housing prices in the United States. Shiller actually believes the two phenomena are related; as investors lost confidence in the stock market and moved their money into real estate, one asset class fell while the other rose. According to Shiller's analysis, the pattern is destined to repeat itself.</p><p> Aside from the initial data, the real strength of <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> is the straightforward, almost clinical way in which it explains why things happen as they do. The book walks readers through structural reasons for market bubbles, then ventures into "softer" analyses which professional economists less confident than Shiller would be scared to touch. It examines cultural factors behind market bubbles, such as hype-mongering news media, and psychological factors, such as herd behavior.</p><p> Another improvement in this latest edition of Shiller's book is his inclusion of more personal commentary, and he mentions the influence that his wife, herself a clinical psychologist, has had on his intellectual development and his view of psychological impacts on economic behavior. Other personal insights from Shiller center on experiences he had while touring and lecturing around the first book, and some of the most interesting passages are those in which he describes common questions or feedback from his audience, and what he thought in reaction--but didn't voice while on his tour.</p><p> In the end, Shiller closes his book with an intriguing set of policy proposals. He argues for a revamping of the U.S. social security system, a new system of house-price insurance for homeowners, and risk reduction through portfolio diversification. Fans of the brainy academic will note with approval that Shiller practices what he preaches: he has begun trying to implement some of his ideas in the real world through two private consulting firms he has founded, Macro Securities Research and Macro Financial. The hope is if Shiller's as correct with this second book as he was with his first, readers will all learn something from these new companies. <i>--Peter Han</i></p><b>Robert J.

He has written a great many short stories under different names and several novels. Among his many translations are <i>Prometheus: A Life of Balzac</i> by Andre Maurois, <i>My Life and Films</i> by Jean Renoir, and <i>The Future of Man</i> by Teilhard de Chardin.From the Introduction by Peter Washington- Victor Hugo might be regarded as the Mr Toad of French literature: vain, arrogrant, pompous, selfish, cold and stingy; a windbag, a humbug and a fraud, absurdly puffed up with the immensity of his own greatness. But unlike Mr Toad, he was also an astute and energetic promoter of hisown image as a Great Man. The process began early. Writing in Hugo&#39;s lifetime, Virginie Ancelot recalls the reception the young poet received in literary drawing-rooms when he arrived to read his latest ode. &#34;...There was a few moments&#39; silence; then someone rose and approached him with visible emotion, took his hand and raised their eyes to heaven.The multitude listened. A single word was heard, to the great surprise of the uninitiated. And this word, which echoed in every corner of the salon, was:&#39;Cathedral!&#39;Then the orator returned to his place; another rose and cried out: &#39;Ogive!&#39;A third looked round him and ventured:&#39;Egyptian Pyramid!&#39;The assembly applauded, and then it was lost in profound reflection.&#34; To the Anglo-Saxon mind - and, it should be said, to many Frenchmen - this is Parisian literary life at its worst: the posturing, the pretension, the self-regard, masquerading under the name of art. Yet Hugo is the man who wrote a handful of the most exquisite lyrics - &#39;Victor Hugo, helas!&#39;said Gide when someone asked him to name the finest French poet - and at least one novel judged to be supreme. In his person, he sums up all that is most monsterous in writerly vanity; in his best work he transcended his failings. How did he do it? How did a monster come to write the masterpiece that is Les Miserables? * In an early essay on Scott, Hugo prophesies that&#34;After the picturesque but prosaic novel of Walter Scott, there will still be another novel to create ... It is the novel which is at once drama and epic, picturesque and poetic, real and ieal, true and great, the novel which will enshrine Walter Scott in Homer.&#34;These words were written in 1823, just after the publication of his own first novel, Han d&#39;Islande, and there is no doubt that Hugo had himself in mind as the man who could &#39;enshrine Walter Scott as Homer&#39;. Anyone who can still get through this book may take a rather different view. Set in seventeeth-century Norway and dripping with gore on every page, Han d&#39;Islande is nearer to the Gothic horror tradition than to Scott. For the man who really succeeded in reconciling the genres of epic and historic fiction we have to look further afield, to Hugo&#39;s own admirerer, Tolstoy. Yet it was Tolstoy who vindicated the French novelist&#39;s early ambition by judging Les Miserables one of the world&#39;s great novels, if not the greates, and acknowledged its effect on his own work. Les Miserables was completed in 1862, shortly before the Russian novelist began War and Peace. The two novels are set in the same period. It cannot be said that Hugo had much to teach his junior about structure or characterization; like all his attempts at epic, in prose and verse, Les Miserables rambles, there are huge digressions and absurdities of plot, the characters are often thin, the action melodramatic. But in spacious, vigorous story-telling, in the use of an historical framework, in the relating of human events to a larger philosophical and spiritual context, in the deployment of fiction as a social and political weapon, in the exalatation of &#39;the people&#39; as a supreme authority, in the treatment of suffering as a dominant theme - in all these matters, Hugo exerted a profound influence on Tolstoy. Without his example, War and Peace might have been a very different novel. Perhaps the most extraordinary point of contact between them concerns Napoleon. One might expect the emperor to intrigue European writers in the early nineteenth century, as he intrigues Byron, Balzac and Stendhal, among others, but by the 1860s almost half a century had passed since Waterloo, yet Hugo and Tolstoy are still trying to unravel the mystery of one whose shadow falls across the entire century. For Tolstoy, Napoleon is pre-eminently a human being - an extraordinary man, certainly, the instrument of destiny, but still a man. For Hugo he is more like a superman, a mysterious brooding presence with almost divine powers. The point is made by an ironic comparison between Napoleon and Wellington. Hugo&#39;s argument seems to be that Napoleon ought to have won Waterloo by sheer force of genius - indeed, that he did win it, when judged according to the rules of natural justice - but that Wellington achieved a victory on points by taking more care to spy out the lay of the battlefield and to estimate the balance of forces. Calculation is everything to the mundane Englishman, imagination nothing. When lightning flashes round the emperor&#39;s head, the duke looks like a very ordinary man. While Napoleon surveys the heavens, Wellington consults his watch. Clearly, the image of general as genius was vital to Hugo&#39;s own project of himself as a literary Napoleon, but there is more to it than that. Commentators have often lamented the digression on Waterloo which is quite unnecessary to the plot and, coming early in the book, throws it decisively out of its narrative stride. But Hugo, though careless of structural refinement, does have a more serious purpose here - a purpose from which Tolstoy must have learnt much, and not only in his description of Borodino. For Hugo, who in turn learnt so much from Scott, grasped the fact that by imprinting the significance of a decisive historical moment on the minds of his readers he could hugely enlarge the scope of his novel. Precisely because Les Miserables is about little people, the history of a great man is one means of linking their petty lives with the Infinite. (The link is made touchingly explicit in the chapter called &#39;In Which Little Gavroche Takes Advantage of Napoleon the Great&#39;.) Even events as great as Waterloo, we are told, can hinge on details: the location of a ditch, the arrival of a platoon. Conversely, the most trivial life may exemplify a great truth - and in that sense, all lives are equally significant, for every existence embodies these truths. At the same time, Hugo&#39;s treatment of Waterloo makes it clear that realities and appearances diverge as much in everyday life as they do in historical interpretation - and that the two divergences are linked. What a post-Waterloo Frenchman thinks of Napoleon helps to shape what he thinks of himself. Sometimes we try to envision history in our own image; sometimes we use it to understand ourselves; at all times we are formed by it without our knowledge. One function of fiction is to help us achieve that knowledge. Les Miserables is, among other things, an attempt to explain the people of the mid-nineteenth century to themselves. Jean Valjean finds himself in a certain situation because he is a poor Frenchman at a particular time. This is one version of Fate - the sociological and political explanation of things. But Valjean is like Waterloo: his life also has a deeper purpose, a hidden meaning. Hugo has a number of names for this meaning - Fate, Destiny, God, the Infinite. But whatever he calls it, we observe a complex dialogue throughout the book between the surface causes of Valjean&#39;s predicament - poverty and ignorance - and their deeper meaning, to which he penetrates through suffering.</p><h2>The Secret Warriors: A Men at War Novel</h2><p>The second installment of the series--following The Last Heroes--continues the adventures of the Office of Strategic Services&#39;s men around the globe during World War II, involving its operatives in covert operations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 175,000 first printing.</p><p>W.E.B.

Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Sister Carrie, Dreiser&#39;s great first novel, transformed the conventional &#34;fallen woman&#34; story into a bold and truly innovative piece of fiction when it appeared in 1900. Naive young Caroline Meeber, a small-town girl seduced by the lure of the modern city, becomes the mistress of a traveling salesman and then of a saloon manager, who elopes with her to New York. Both its subject matter and Dreiser&#39;s unsparing, nonjudgmental approach made Sister Carrie a controversial book in its time, and the work retains the power to shock readers today.</p><h2>McDougal Littell Literature Connections: Student Text A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream 1996</h2><p>McDougal Littell Literature Connections: A Midsummer Night s Dream Student Editon Grade 10 1996</p><p></p><h2>Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950</h2><p>The northern New Mexico village of Taos, shaped through the centuries by American Indian and Hispanic Catholic cultures, is an unusual setting for a study of art patronage. Yet nowhere did relationships between artists and patrons play a more pivotal role in American artists' survival during the first half of the twentieth century. Why did artists go to Taos?

Scientists thought they could only float on water since they were so big. Boy, were they wrong! Even today, notions about dinosaurs are being revised as new discoveries are made. This lively book offers fascinating insight into how certain theories were formulated, and then how those theories were proved or disproved.</p><p>Kathleen Kudlinksi the award-winning author of more than forty books for children, including&nbsp; the Boy, Were We Wrong series. She lives in Connecticut and Vermont.*Starred Review* K-Gr. 3. What could be more heartening to children than the unabashed admission that grown-ups make mistakes? Science has had its share of theories once accepted as fact but later superseded, and the mystery of dinosaur fossils seems to have brought out the imaginative side of scientists. Beginning with the ancient Chinese, who decided that dinosaur fossils came from dragons that still lived, the story fast-forwards to nineteenth-century scientists, who guessed that Iguanodon'<i>s</i> sharp, conical bone was a spike on its head, rather than a spur on its hand. One mistaken idea after another is examined and illustrated with an ink drawing juxtaposed against a single-color background. Further information comes to light, and the information is corrected on a page showing a dinosaur drawing tinted with full-color washes. Intelligently designed and imaginatively conceived, the artwork makes the text more understandable and the whole book more beautiful. It also reflects the outlook of the text, portraying the scientists of each generation as earnest, sometimes puzzled searchers who did the best they could with the evidence available. The ending returns to the Chinese beliefs, stating that if birds are the descendants of dinosaurs, then they still live. Best of all, the closing paragraph acknowledges that the search is not over yet: the children fascinated by this book may one day find new answers to old questions about the dinosaurs. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The volumes are the product of a remarkable cooperative effort on the part of five of the most distinguished Einstein scholars.

In doing so they have given us deep new insights on Einstein&#x2019;s creativity and on creativity in general, on context, on the role of past resources and expertise, and on the function of analogies.

When it began, only 35 years after the end of slavery, few could envision what the 20th century would hold for black Americans. The 100 men and women described in this compendium, written by two of the most prominent black scholars and social commentators in America, represent important moments in the struggle to deepen America's democratic roots against the overwhelming forces of racism and bigotry. By choosing 100 (10 per decade), Gates and West ensured that they would have to omit important black figures. Nevertheless, the profiles achieve their purpose: to demonstrate and celebrate the multifaceted and profound achievements of African Americans in fields as diverse as science, politics, the military, literature, entertainment, and academia. <p> From W.E.B. Du Bois, probably the greatest African American intellectual of the 20th century, to Tiger Woods, golf's first black superstar, the well-written, fact-filled profiles present those who have lived extraordinary lives and shown tremendous courage. The roster includes the well-known, such as Louis Armstrong, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks, and Oprah Winfrey, as well as the more obscure but no less important. These include Carter G. Woodson, who pioneered the historical study of black America; Charles Richard Drew, who founded two of the world's largest blood banks and in so doing prevented millions of deaths; and Barbara Harris, the first woman bishop. Gates and West also embrace controversial figures such as Louis Farrakhan, Tupac Shakur, and Angela Davis, emphasizing their positive imprints while acknowledging their complexity. With this valuable addition to black history collections, the authors (both controversial in their own rights) continue their quest to fill the aching gaps in public awareness about African Americans and remind us that self-confidence, dignity, and excellence are the essential virtues in the great historical drama of American democracy. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,</b> is the W.

Yet he places every battle in a wide perspective, revealing their significance to America's development as it grew from a new Republic on the edge of a threatening frontier to a global superpower.<br> <em>Decision at Sea</em> is a powerful and illuminating look at pivotal moments in the history of the Navy and of the United States. It is also a compelling study of the unchanging demands of leadership at sea, where commanders must make rapid decisions in the heat of battle with lives--and the fate of nations--hanging in the balance.</p><p><br><strong>Craig L.

The whole book is an effortless read, presenting a natural flow of history beginning with the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813 and ending with Operation Praying Mantis in 1988."--Linda Wheeler, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"A riveting account of the morphing of the United States Navy from its humble beginnings in the forests and lakes of the North American wilderness to an awesome and overwhelming strike force that cements the United States' position as the world's remaining superpower and de facto policeman."--<em>Proceedings</em> (The United States Naval Institute)<p></p><br>"Without question, <em>Decision at Sea</em> is a riveting, well-researched account of the U.S. Navy in action. Historian Craig Symonds should be saluted for writing an important and living narrative that shows how sea battles shaped the course of American history." --Douglas Brinkley, author of <em>Tour of Duty</em> and <em>The Unfinished Presidency</em><p></p><br>"Craig Symonds delivers American naval history in the tradition of Sir Edward Creasy's <em>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</em>. Combat at sea, from the Great Lakes to the Persian Gulf, jumps form the page in a vibrant, arresting narrative. Complementing each battle piece is an informed argument about the engagement's impact on the course of history."--Alex Roland, Duke University<p></p><br>"Craig Symonds, one of America's leading naval historians, has written a fascinating battle history that also provides thoughtful insights into the American character and the character of America at pivotal moments in the last 225 years. His prose is very accessible and provocative, particularly as he portrays what the future may hold for the U.S. Navy at the apogee of its power."--William S. Dudley, Former Director, U.S. Naval Historical Center<p></p><br>"<em>Decision at Sea</em> combines the wisdom of Alfred Thayer Mahan with the eminent readability we have come to expect from Craig Symonds. This book is destined to be a classic of both naval literature and national strategy."--Thomas Cutler, U.S. Naval Institute, author of <em>A Sailor's History of the U.S.</em> <em>Navy</em> and <em>The Battle of Leyte Gulf</em><p></p><br>"Craig Symonds' <em>Decision at Sea</em> deftly integrates five vigorous battle narratives with a comparative analysis that highlights the changing character and recurring critical role the U.S. Navy has played in American history."--John B.

He entered Boston Grammar School when he was eight and later attended George Brown Ell&#x2019;s school. When he was twelve his father apprenticed him to his half-brother James as a printer. James was later the publisher of the <b>New England Courant</b>, where Franklin&#x2019;s first articles, <b>The Dogood Papers</b>, were published before he was seventeen. He went to Philadelphia in 1723 and pursued his trade of printer. He was befriended by William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania, who offered to help the young man get started in business. Franklin left for England, where he hoped to arrange for the purchase of printing equipment. Arriving in London in 1724, he was soon deserted by Keith, and again turned to printing for a livelihood. His privately printed <b>Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</b> (1725) introduced him to leading Deists and other intellectuals in London. A year later, he returned to Philadelphia, and by 1730 he had been appointed public printer for Pennsylvania. In 1731 he established the first circulation library in the United States; in 1743-44, The American Philosophical Society. In 1748 he retired from the trade of printer but continued to advise and back his partner and to draw profit from the business. <b>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanack</b> was his most spectacular success as a publisher, having gone through numerous editions and been translated in many languages. During the next thirty-five years he devoted himself largely to politics and diplomacy, but still wrote and engaged in scientific ventures. He resigned as Minister to France in 1785, returned to America, and was elected President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Still concerned with the rights of the individual, he published papers encouraging the abolition of slavery. He died in Philadelphia in 1790.The indispensable edition of Frankliniana.</p><h2>Cowboy Princess: Life with My Parents Roy Rogers and Dale Evans</h2><p>In this book the eldest daughter of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans tells the story of America&#39;s most famous cowboy and cowgirl.</p><p><b>Cheryl Rogers-Barnett</b> is the oldest daughter of Roy and Dale Evans.

It can tell us why the night is dark, what causes the tides, and even how best to catch a baseball. With <i>In Praise of Simple Physics</i>, popular math and science writer Paul Nahin presents a plethora of situations that explore the science and math behind the wonders of everyday life. Roaming through a diverse range of puzzles, he illustrates how physics shows us ways to wring more energy from renewable sources, to measure the gravity in our car garages, to figure out which of three light switches in the basement controls the light bulb in the attic, and much, much more.</p><p>How fast can you travel from London to Paris? How do scientists calculate the energy of an atomic bomb explosion? How do you kick a football so it stays in the air and goes a long way downfield? Nahin begins with simpler problems and progresses to more challenging questions, and his entertaining, accessible, and scientifically and mathematically informed explanations are all punctuated by his trademark humor. Readers are presumed to have some background in beginning differential and integral calculus. Whether you simply have a personal interest in physics' influence in the world or you're an engineering and science student who wants to gain more physics know-how, this book has an intriguing scenario for you.</p><p><i>In Praise of Simple Physics</i> proves that if we look carefully at the world around us, physics has answers for the most astonishing day-to-day occurrences.</p></p><p><p>"<i>In Praise of Simple Physics</i> offers a masterful look at how basic principles, combined with clever thinking and fundamental mathematics, lead to satisfying explanations of an extraordinary range of natural phenomena, from the path of a football to why the sky is dark at night.

The text used for this edition is based upon that of the first edition published in 1853.</p><p>As interest in 19th-century English literature by women has been reinvigorated by a resurgence in popularity of the works of Jane Austen, readers are rediscovering a writer whose fiction, once widely beloved, fell by the wayside. British novelist ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL (1810-1865)--whose books were sometimes initially credited to, simply, "Mrs. Gaskell"--is now recognized as having created some of the most complex and progressive depictions of women in the literature of the age, and is today justly celebrated for her precocious use of the regional dialect and slang of England's industrial North. <p> Ruth--Gaskell's third novel, first published in three volumes in 1853--is notable as one of the rare instances in the fiction of the era of a positive portrayal of unwed motherhood and for its thematic condemnation of the social stigma of illegitimacy. The tale of a young woman seduced and abandoned by her lover, then taken in and protected by a kindly minister and his sister, it is remarkably progressive for the period. </p><p> Friend and literary companion to the likes of Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bront�--the latter of whom Gaskell wrote an acclaimed 1857 biography--Gaskell is today being restored to her rightful place alongside them.

Aristotle had one vision (the realm of the celestial spheres is perfect), and Einstein another (all motion is relativistic). More often than not, these different understandings begin with a simple drawing, a pre-mathematical picture of reality. Such drawings are a humble but effective tool of the physicist's craft, part of the tradition of thinking, teaching, and learning passed down through the centuries. This book uses drawings to help explain fifty-one key ideas of physics accessibly and engagingly. Don Lemons, a professor of physics and author of several physics books, pairs short, elegantly written essays with simple drawings that together convey important concepts from the history of physical science.</p><p>Lemons proceeds chronologically, beginning with Thales' discovery of triangulation, the Pythagorean monocord, and Archimedes' explanation of balance. He continues through Leonardo's description of &#x201c;earthshine&#x201d; (the ghostly glow between the horns of a crescent moon), Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and Newton's cradle (suspended steel balls demonstrating by their collisions that for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction). Reaching the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Lemons explains the photoelectric effect, the hydrogen atom, general relativity, the global greenhouse effect, Higgs boson, and more. The essays place the science of the drawings in historical context&#x2015;describing, for example, Galileo's conflict with the Roman Catholic Church over his teaching that the sun is the center of the universe, the link between the discovery of electrical phenomena and the romanticism of William Wordsworth, and the shadow cast by the Great War over Einstein's discovery of relativity. </p><p>Readers of <i>Drawing Physics</i> with little background in mathematics or physics will say, &#x201c;Now I see, and now I understand.&#x201d; </p></p><p>Don S.

His earliest photographs were images of decadent movie palaces built in the 20s and 30s. By timing the exposure of his photos to the exact length of the film being screened, he produced images that depict theater interiors bathed in the magical glare of an all-white screen: pure light. Next Sugimoto began a body of work that he continues to this day, photographing views of the sea from land, traveling around the world to make pictures that, despite their vastly different geographic origins, seem at first to be the same, with only slight variations. Their captions, however, confirm that each is of a different body of water: Caspian, Ligurian, Black. Other series include his out-of-focus impressions of landmark architectural monuments, wherein the Empire State Building, Le Corbusier's <i>Chapel de Notre Dame du Haut</i>, and Tadao Ando's <i>Church of Light in Osaka</i>, among others, are essentialized rather than documented. This volume presents a monographic retrospective of Hiroshi Sugimoto's complete body of work, including the projects described above and others. New, mostly unpublished images from his recent color work are featured: impressions of the impeccably proportioned shrine Sugimoto designed in Naoshima Island in Japan, as well as a series entitled <i>Colors of Shadow</i>. Specially commissioned essays by photography curators David Elliot and Kerry Brougher examine Sugimoto's work in depth, while an exhibition history and bibliography round out the volume.</p><p>Hiroshi Sugimoto was born in Tokyo in 1948. He studied photography at the Center College of Design in Los Angeles before moving to New York in the 70s. His work has been exhibited internationally, including at the Berkeley Art Museum, California; the 10th Biennial of Sydney, Australia; capc MusEe de l&#39;Art Contemporain, Bordeaux; the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh; the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; and The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><h2>Energy at the Crossroads: Global Perspectives and Uncertainties (MIT Press)</h2><p><p>In <i>Energy at the Crossroads</i>, Vaclav Smil considers the twenty-first century's crucial question: how to reconcile the modern world's unceasing demand for energy with the absolute necessity to preserve the integrity of the biosphere. With this book he offers a comprehensive, accessible guide to today's complex energy issues -- how to think clearly and logically about what is possible and what is desirable in our energy future.</p><p>After a century of unprecedented production growth, technical innovation, and expanded consumption, the world faces a number of critical energy challenges arising from unequal resource distribution, changing demand patterns, and environmental limitations. The fundamental message of <i>Energy at the Crossroads</i> is that our dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced not because of any imminent resource shortages but because the widespread burning of oil, coal, and natural gas damages the biosphere and presents increasing economic and security problems as the world relies on more expensive supplies and Middle Eastern crude oil.</p><p>Smil begins with an overview of the twentieth century's long-term trends and achievements in energy production. He then discusses energy prices, the real cost of energy, and "energy linkages" -- the effect energy issues have on the economy, on quality of life, on the environment, and in wartime. He discusses the pitfalls of forecasting, giving many examples of failed predictions and showing that unexpected events can disprove complex models. And he examines the pros and cons not only of fossil fuels but also of alternative fuels such as hydroenergy, biomass energy, wind power, and solar power. Finally, he considers the future, focusing on what really matters, what works, what is realistic, and which outcomes are most desirable.</p></p><p><p>Vaclav Smil is the author of more than thirty books on energy, the environment, food, and the history of technical advances, including <i>Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature</i>, published by the MIT Press. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba.

Interpreted by some as a paean to personal avarice, Smiles's most celebrated book is in fact a practical and engaging tribute to the working- and lower-middle classes, in whom he identified the capacity for self-improvement and for whom he tirelessly advocated the right of social advancement. Part practical guide, part proverbial testament, part secular hagiography, this literary hybrid turns biography into an inspirational medium that awakens the reader to their own potential and instills the desire to succeed. Smiles's book is the precursor of today's motivational and self-help literature, although its vision is significantly more cosmopolitan than that of most books in an ever-expanding genre.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

But unlike the feel-good cheerleading that the term "self-help" says to us today, to Smiles it might well have been synonymous with "hard work." For this 1859 volume is dedicated to "stimulat[ing] youths to apply themselves diligently to right pursuits,--sparing neither labour, pains, nor self-denial in prosecuting them--and to rely upon their own efforts in life." <p> Though the author himself admits his lessons are "old-fashioned but wholesome," he nevertheless delivers stern but well-intentioned lectures on such commonsense concepts as the importance of learning from failure, how work is the best teacher, and the value of thrift, gentility, and honesty, all peppered with examples of such noble industry from the lives of writers, scientists, artists, inventors, educators, philanthropists, missionaries, and--gulp!--martyrs. It's as if all paternal wisdom had been reduced to a single book.</p>Peter W.

Anyone with an interest in current events in the region will find here an insightful and well-written guide to the history of its five national states&#x2015;Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Traces of a common past invite us to make generalizations about the region, even to posit the idea of a Central American nation. But, as Hector Perez-Brignoli shows us, we can learn more from a comparative approach that establishes both the points of convergence and the separate paths taken by the five different countries of Central America.<br><br>The author offers a concise overview of the region's history from the sixteenth century to the present, beginning with human and cultural geography in the first chapter and ending with the present crisis in the last. He deals with the fundamental themes and problems of the area: the characteristics of the colonial heritage, independence and the crisis of the Federal Republic, the formation of nation-states during the nineteenth century, and the development of export agriculture based on coffee and bananas. The narrative moves finally into the twentieth century to look at the growing impoverishment that multiplies inequalities and leads to the shipwreck of liberal democracy.

Even for living things, in the natural sciences and often in the social sciences, the same is true. A modern botanist would not say that plants pursue sunlight. This has not always been the case, nor, perhaps, was it inevitable. Since the seventeenth century, many thinkers have made agency, in various forms, central to science.<br><br><i>The Restless Clock</i> examines the history of this principle, banning agency, in the life sciences. It also tells the story of dissenters embracing the opposite idea: that agency is essential to nature. The story begins with the automata of early modern Europe, as models for the new science of living things, and traces questions of science and agency through Descartes, Leibniz, Lamarck, and Darwin, among many others. Mechanist science, Jessica Riskin shows, had an associated theology: the argument from design, which found evidence for a designer in the mechanisms of nature. Rejecting such appeals to a supernatural God, the dissenters sought to naturalize agency rather than outsourcing it to a &#x201c;divine engineer.&#x201d; Their model cast living things not as passive but as <i>active</i>, self-making machines.<br><br> The conflict between passive- and active-mechanist approaches maintains a subterranean life in current science, shaping debates in fields such as evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. This history promises not only to inform such debates, but also our sense of the possibilities for what it means to engage in science&#x2014;and even what it means to be alive.</p><p><b>Jessica Riskin </b>is professor of history at Stanford University and author of <i>Science in the Age of Sensibility: The Sentimental Empiricists of the French Enlightenment</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press."<i>The Restless Clock</i> examines more than four centuries of debate over the extent to which living beings can be understood as governed by 'mechanism,' and in the process it reorients our understanding of some of the most important themes and individuals in the Western canon during this period, including the thought of Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Lamarck, and Darwin, plus contemporaries such as Dennett, Dawkins, and Gould, among others. Riskin has written a work of tremendous intellectual scope and accomplishment." (<i>Ken Alder, author of The Lie Detectors</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Restless Clock</i> is a sweeping survey of the search for answers to the mystery of life. Riskin writes with clarity and wit, and the breadth of her scholarship is breathtaking." (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"The most influential book of the past twenty years. . . . Interest in the similarities and the differences between human beings and machines goes back many centuries--and Jessica Riskin's <i>The Restless Clock</i> is a rich and resonant telling of that long history. . . . Riskin's sweeping survey isn&#x2019;t didactic or moralizing, but it contains two vitally important lessons for us: Never bet against human ingenuity in making machines do what people once considered impossible. And never bet against human ingenuity in redefining the uniquely human such that machine-intelligence can never match our own."<br> &nbsp; (Steven Shapin <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"At the heart of this scientific and cultural history is the concept of agency&#x2014;the capacity to act&#x2014;in nature. Riskin reveals how two distinct interpretations emerged from the mechanical Universe of the Enlightenment: Isaac Newton&#x2019;s passive version, reliant on a divine tinkerer; and Gottfried Leibniz&#x2019;s, which saw life as purposeful and 'self-transforming.' Riskin&#x2019;s investigation of this duality, by way of Renaissance automatons, the gestation of evolutionary theory and quantum mechanics, is engrossing and illuminating."&nbsp; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"In this impressive cultural and intellectual narrative of the sciences of life and the techniques of mechanics, Riskin shows decisively how a richer and broader history of such sciences offers indispensable lessons for controversies surrounding agency and purpose in our understanding of the world. <i>The Restless Clock</i> explores fascinating projects launched by medieval churchmen and Renaissance artisans, enlightened philosophers and modern experimenters. It documents the construction of automata and experimentation in biology, the ambitions of Darwinism and of germ theory, the visions of cybernetics and of neurosciences. These stories reveal the power and importance of a tradition of living machines within the development of western sciences that has been strangely underestimated or dismissed. Its legacies today need just this kind of astute re-evaluation.<br><br> This book will become a central reference for many vital debates about the long history of life sciences and the possible futures of intelligent machines."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Simon Schaffer, coauthor of Leviathan and the Air-Pump</i>)<br><br>"In this original and masterful book, Riskin recounts how scientists, philosophers, artists, and mechanics have wrestled with the nature of vital entities on the page and canvas, in the workshop and in stone. Here among others are Vaucanson and Kant, Descartes, Leibniz, and Darwin, defecating ducks, talking heads, and robots&#x2014;giving us both the unfamiliar and the familiar in a new light, presented with deft analysis in luminous prose." (<i>Daniel J. Kevles, author of The Baltimore Case</i>)<br><br>"Riskin&#x2019;s book begins with Descartes and automata and traces the development of ideas about what animates living things up to the present. Science long ago moved away from theories about a divine clockmaker, but Riskin says some of the ideas from that period persist in surprising form. In particular, she says, atheist philosophers and scientists who regard consciousness in purely mechanistic terms, are inadvertently borrowing a schematic that, in a different time, struck people as evidence of God." (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Restless Clock </i>is gorgeous and erudite, full of flute-playing androids and defecating ducks, animal spirits and invisible forces. It explores the hardest problems: where does life come from, and how is it that thoughts seem to dance out of grey matter? This is a book that brings history and language to bear on contemporary science&#x2014;an important thing in itself in an age where science sometimes looks set to obliterate the humanities.&#x201d; (<i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br>"Wide-ranging, witty, and astonishingly learned." (<i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"This timeless fascination with the question of what it means to be living has been explored most recently be Riskin, a history professor at Stanford University. In her latest book, <i>The Restless Clock</i>, she moves past the previous theologically and philosophically grounded discussions and looks at these questions of autonomy through the lens of a historian....By putting forth these questions in the words of past intellectuals, Riskin engages the reader in evaluating these existential questions with respect to big-picture &#x201c;processes&#x201d; like evolution, artificial intelligence and epistemology."

In its short length are condensed enormous erudition and impressive analytical scope. With verve and self-assurance, it addresses a broad, central question: How can we improve our understanding of the large-scale processes and structures that transformed the world of the nineteenth century and are transforming our world today? Tilly contends that twentieth-century social theories have been encumbered by a nineteenth century heritage of "pernicious postulates." He subjects each misleading belief to rigorous criticism, challenging many standard social science paradigms and methodologies. As an alternative to those timeless, placeless models of social change and organization, Tilly argues convincingly for a program of concrete, historically grounded analysis and systematic comparison. To illustrate the strategies available for such research, Tilly assesses the works of several major practitioners of comparative historical analysis, making skillful use of this selective review to offer his own speculative, often unconventional accounts of our recent past. Historically oriented social scientists will welcome this provocative essay and its wide-ranging agenda for comparative historical research. Other social scientists, their graduate and undergraduate students, and even the interested general reader will find this new work by a major scholar stimulating and eminently readable. This is the second of five volumes commissioned by the Russell Sage Foundation to mark its seventy-fifth anniversary. "In this short, brilliant book Tilly suggests a way to think about theories of historical social change....This book should find attentive readers both in undergraduate courses and in graduate seminars. It should also find appreciative readers, for Tilly is a writer as well as a scholar." &#x2014;Choice</p></p><p>CHARLES&nbsp;TILLY is at the New School for Social Research.</p><h2>The Great Graph Contest</h2><p>Two comical creatures go crazy with graphs in an imaginative look at organizing information.

Features over 3,500 entries and 32 pages of color art and maps. Developed in cooperation with Encyclop�dia Britannica.&#34;</p><p><p>For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America's leading and most-trusted provider of language information. All Merriam-Webster products and services are backed by the largest team of professional dictionary editors and writers in America, and one of the largest in the world.</p>Merriam-Webster has put together a marvelous one-volume, easy-to-lift-with-one-hand, desktop encyclopedia on world religions. As with many Webster's publications (e.g., The Encyclopedia of Literature and The Biographical Dictionary) the editors here have emphasized comprehensiveness (over 3500 articles) and clarity of writing--and added to these a dispassionate, nonjudgmental, and nonproselytizing reporting of religious concepts, movements, figures, divinities, and sacred sites. Edited and written by eminent scholars, this is a portable, authoritative source. Heavily cross referenced, it also includes a handy pronunciation guide, useful for pronouncing non-English words. But editorial restrictions and space limitations have led to some absurdly abbreviated entries, creating uneven or inadequate coverage. The late Reverend Jim Jones has a bigger write-up than Cain; Aum Shinrikyo is discussed more completely than the Essenes; the Tibetan Book of the Dead is explained in two sentences. In the battle between space and content, space has scored many victories; a little of everything wins out over more of fewer things. But for immediate access to authoritative definitions, this book is impeccable. Recommended for all libraries.<br><i>-Glenn Norio Masuchika, Chaminade Univ.

Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton.<br>Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine.</p>"</p><h2>Mansfield Park (Chiltern Classic)</h2><p>Adultery is not a typical Jane Austen theme, but when it disturbs the relatively peaceful household at Mansfield Park, it has quite unexpected results. The diffident and much put-upon heroine Fanny Price has to struggle to cope with the results, re-examining her own feelings while enduring the cheerful amorality, old-fashioned indifference and priggish disapproval of those around her.</p><p>Jane Austen was born in Steventon rectory on 16th December 1775. Her family later moved to Bath and then to Chawton in Hampshire. She wrote from a young age and Pride and Prejudice was begun when she was twenty-two years old. It was originally called First Impressions. It was initially rejected by the published she submitted it too and eventually published in 1813 after much revision.</p><h2>The Image of Christ</h2><p><p><i>The Image of Christ </i>expresses the view that modern secular audiences can engage with the masterpieces of Christian art at an emotional as well as a purely aesthetic or historical level. This book aims to help the viewer understand these pictures by focusing&nbsp;attention on the purpose for which they were made, and explores what they might have meant to their original viewers.<br><br>The authors trace how a recognizable image of Christ&nbsp;evolved, starting with the earliest symbols and metaphorical images such as the Sheperd, the Lamb and the Vine. They trace the emergence of a "true likeness," emphasizing the importance of the Veronica, the&nbsp;"miraculous portrait" said to have been imprinted on the cloth held out to Jesus on the way to Calvary. They describe how artists conveyed the paradox of&nbsp;Christ's dual nature&#x2014;human and divine, weak and powerful, victim and victor&#x2014;in portrayals of his infancy. They also show how&nbsp;images of Christ's suffering during the Passion were intended to convey a&nbsp;cosmic,&nbsp;not just a personal significance. Artists have attempted to put extremes of suffering and despair into an overal context of hope&#x2013;a vein of hope that runs from the catacombs to Hiroshima and beyond.<br><br>These are images&nbsp;that speak, even to those who do not hold Christian beliefs. Artists had to make it clear that in representing the life and death of Jesus they were offering a continuing truth; we the spectators have to become eyewitnesses to an&nbsp;event that matters to us now. As a result, the different moments and aspects of Christ's life become, in the hands of great artists, a reflection of all human experience. The&nbsp;Virgin nursing her son&nbsp;expresses the&nbsp;feelings of love every mother has for her child. Christ mocked in innocence beset by violence. Christ risen and appearing to Mary Magdalene is a universal reaffirmation that love cannot be destroyed by death. Beyond their obvious religious significance, these are paintings that have a universal&nbsp;meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><i>The Image of Christ</i> by Gabriele Finaldi is a beautifully illustrated, colorful history of how Christ has been portrayed by artists from the early church to the present. It is not, however, a life of Christ told in pictures. Instead, the book explores the challenges Christian artists have faced as they have tried to imagine what Jesus looked like. Since no eyewitness descriptions of Jesus' physical appearance survived, the earliest artists' depictions of Christ played on the symbols and images that he used in his parables--such as the Good Shepherd, the Light, and the Vine. Later, artists became concerned with capturing Christ's true physical likeness, based on miraculous relics such as the cloth that Saint Veronica offered him on his way to Calvary, which was believed to be imprinted with an image of his face. These stages in the history of Christian art are described by several art historians in brief essays, each of which is lavishly illustrated. The book, which was inspired by <i>Seeing Salvation: The Image of Christ</i>, an exhibition at the National Gallery, London, will be treasured by secular and believing readers alike. A deeper understanding of the religious context of these works will sharpen viewers' experience of their universal relevance. The dozens of pictures, paintings, and sculptures reproduced here bear profound witness not only to the events of Jesus' life, but also to the enduring power of a mother's love for her children, the suffering of innocents, and love's triumph over death. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Gabriele Finaldi</b> is Deputy Director of the Prado Museum, Madrid, and a former curator ofthe National Gallery, London. <b>Neil MacGregor</b> is Director of the British Museum, London&nbsp;and former director of the National Gallery, London. <b>Susanna Avery-Quash</b> is Research Curator in the History of Collecting at the National Gallery, London. <b>Xavier Bray</b> is Chief Curator at Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, and a former Curator at the National Gallery, London. <b>Erika Langmuir</b> is former Head of Education at the National Gallery, London. <b>Alexander Strugis</b> is Director of The Holburne Museum of Art, Bath.</p><h2>The Social Media Sales Revolution: The New Rules for Finding Customers, Building Relationships, and Closing More Sales Through Online Networking</h2><p><p><b>Cold-calling is history&#x2015;your future is in social media!</b></p> <p>The growth of LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook have revolutionized how business is done.

Now, of course, socialism is widely discredited; even former Communists in Eastern Europe proclaim allegiance to a market economy. This engrossing history of various socialist movements is told through portraits of the leaders who provided the intellectual and political support for those movements. With eloquence, skepticism, and even sympathy, Muravchik examines the careers of figures as varied as Friedrich Engels, Clement Atlee, and Julius Nyerere. Although each had a somewhat different interpretation of socialism, they all shared the fatal assumption that they could use the coercive power of the state to "improve" human nature. This is an important work and an object lesson showing great harm is frequently done by those with the purest motives. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Kessell has written the first narrative history devoted to the tumultuous seventeenth century in New Mexico. Setting aside stereotypes of a Native American Eden and the Black Legend of Spanish cruelty, he paints an evenhanded picture of a tense but interwoven coexistence. Beginning with the first permanent Spanish settlement among the Pueblos of the Rio Grande in 1598, he proposes a set of relations more complicated than previous accounts envisioned and then reinterprets the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and the Spanish reconquest in the 1690s. Kessell clearly describes the Pueblo world encountered by Spanish conquistador Juan de O�ate and portrays important but lesser-known Indian partisans, all while weaving analysis and interpretation into the flow of life in seventeenth-century New Mexico.</p><p>Brimming with new insights embedded in an engaging narrative, Kessell&#x2019;s work presents a clearer picture than ever before of events leading to the Pueblo Revolt. <i>Pueblos, Spaniards, and the Kingdom of New Mexico</i> is the definitive account of a volatile era.</p></p><p><b>John L.

His <em>Bridge of San Luis Rey</em>, one of seven novels, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, as did two of his four full-length dramas, <em>Our Town</em> (1938) and <em>The Skin of Our Teeth</em> (1943). Wilder's <em>The Matchmaker</em> was adapted as the musical <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>. He also enjoyed enormous success with many other forms of the written and spoken word, among them teaching, acting, the opera, and films. (His screenplay for Hitchcock's <em>Shadow of Doubt</em> [1943] remains a classic psycho-thriller to this day.) Wilder's many honors include the Gold Medal for Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the National Book Committee's Medal for Literature.</p></p><h2>Framing Dropouts: Notes on the Politics of an Urban Public High School (SUNY Series, Teacher Empowerment and School Reform)</h2><p>"I think this is the most important work I have read in over a decade on the sociology and politics of school dropouts. Fine combines a narrative structure with a rigorous theoretical discourse that allows the reader to both hear the voices of those involved in the dropout situation as well as to have the opportunity to reflect critically on the ideological and material forces that structure the dropout issue as a social problem. I am convinced that it will be a major influence in the field and will establish a new theoretical standard for inquiry into the area of school dropouts." -- Henry A. Giroux, Professor and Renown Scholar in Residence, Department of Educational Leadership, Miami University<br><br>"As a critical ethnography, this manuscript is thoughtful, compassionate, and compelling. Fine is able to document the 'braiding' of race, class, gender in sophisticated ways and this is one of the text's greatest strengths. The link between those who 'drop out' and the restriction of critique is powerfully achieved. Fine has successfully re-presented the complexities of urban education. She should be applauded for her integration of black and feminist theorists. I believe this text is pioneering. It opens the literature on adolescents placed at risk to include contexts previously ignored. This should be required reading for all school personnel, future teachers, and those associated with educational contexts." -- Deborah P. Britzman, Department of Education, State University of New York, Binghamton<br><br>"What Fine does is show us in depth the reality of the situation we often wish would just go away. We are forced to confront what pain is engendered by our public institutions and consider how we might take up the challenge to do something about it." -- Roger I.

To enhance readers' understanding, Warren W Wiersbe's extensive notes explain Bunyan's references to his own life, to the culture of his day, to this theological perspective, and to the numerous Scripture quotations and allusions.</p> <p><i>The Pilgrims Progress </i>offers as much encouragement to those who are serious about their Christian walk today as it did when first published in 1678.This revised and annotated edition makes the richness of Bunyan's work readily accessible to readers of all ages and backgrounds.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p> John Bunyan (1628-1688), preacher and author, was jailed for his nonconformist preaching. During his imprisonment he devoted himself to Bible study, reading, and writing. He is widely recognized for his narrative genius and his vigorous, simple, concrete writing style. Besides<i> The Pilgrim's Progress, </i>Bunyan wrote several other books, including <i>Grace Abounding </i>and <i>Holy War.</i></p> <p> Warren W. Wiersbe, well-known Bible conference speaker and teacher, has written more than 100 books. His extensive notes in <i>The New Pilgrim's Progress </i>offer invaluable background information for today's readers of this classic.</p> <p> Judith E.

Using many examples from Corbett&#39;s psychotherapy practice and other personal accounts, the book describes various portals through which the sacred may appear: in dreams, visions, the natural world, through the body, in relationships, in our psychopathology, and in our creative work. Using the language and insights of depth psychology, he describes the intimate relationship between spiritual experience and the psychology of the individual, revealing the seamless continuity and intermingling of the personal and transpersonal dimensions of the psyche. Corbett also discusses the problems of evil and suffering from a psychological rather than theological perspective, and suggests some of the reasons that traditional religious institutions fail to address adequately these problems. Based largely on Jung&#39;s writing on religion, b!ut also drawing from contemporary psychoanalyticheory, Corbett describes an approach to spirituality that is gradually emerging alongside the western monotheistic tradition. For those seeking alternative forms of spirituality beyond the Judeo-Christian tradition, this volume will be a useful guide on the journey.</p><p>LIONEL CORBETT, M.D., teaches depth psychology at Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, CA, and is the author of The Religious Function of the Psyche.</p><h2>Contemporary Women&#39;s Health: Issues for Today and the Future</h2><p><i>Contemporary Women&#x2019;s Health</i> emphasizes health promotion and the impact of multicultural and diversity issues on women&#x2019;s health.

The picture should be alive, the statue should be alive and every work of art should be alive." </p><p>Thus Hans Hofmann wrote nearly half a century ago. He left the Old World, Germany, for the New, at the age of 50. In 1948, when the retrospective exhibition was held at the Addison Gallery of American Art, Hofmann was 68; he had been in the United States for 18 years, a citizen for seven years. Yet he was scarcely recognized in Europe or America as an artist of significance and had never had a full-scale retrospective exhibition of his work. Beginning with a group exhibition in Germany in 1909, he had been given 12 one-man shows and had been included in four group exhibitions before the exhibit at Andover. Subsequently, he was to have 33 one-man shows and to be in over 60 group exhibitions, including the 1960 Venice Biennale, in which he was one of the four artists chosen to represent America. </p><p>The catalogue of the 1948 retrospective at the Addison Gallery incorporated Hofmann's writings, all originally written in German, some pieces translated fluently, others awkwardly paraphrasing the original. He had written them over a period of 40 years for periodicals journals, or his own teaching purposes; occasionally they overlapped; there was no sequence of development. In the original volume of <i>Search for the Real</i>, published in 1948, it was felt desirable to edit his writing as little as possible, nevertheless to present the essays in the most lucid English true to his meaning, printed only with his approval. "The Search for the Real in the Visual Arts," "Sculpture," and "Painting and Culture" were all printed in full. The section "Excerpts from the Teaching of Hans Hofmann" was composed of selections from his essays "On the Aims of Art" and "Plastic Creation." The last brief section, "Terms," was gleaned from the other essays, lectures, diagrams, notes, and cryptic memoranda written to himself, headed by one of Hoffman's diagrams. It was a further distillation of his own definitions in the nature of a vocabulary. </p><p>In the last 18 years of his life, recognition was his, nationally and internationally, in proportion to the originality and depth of his thinking, his versatility and comprehensiveness, his productivity and vigor. His was a prophetic visual expression of action in a three-dimensional world on a vibrating two-dimensional surface. He was a dynamic teacher; the wide range of his influence is to be seen in the list of artists comprising an exhibition "Hans Hofmann and His Students," circulated in America and abroad during the three years before his death in 1966. Among the 32 painters and sculptors in this exhibition were students as varied in their developed personal idioms as Helen Frankenthaler, Larry Rivers, Louise Nevelson, Richard Stankiewicz, and Alan Kaprow. Running simultaneously and also shown in South America and Europe as well as in the United States, a one-man show of 40 major works initiated by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, is a testimony to the words of the "dean of the New York School of Abstract-Expressionist Painting."</p></p><p></p><h2>Who Has Seen the Wind ?</h2><p>When W.O.

In this exciting new book, Anton Kaes argues that masterworks such as <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, The Nibelungen</i>, and <i>Metropolis</i>, even though they do not depict battle scenes or soldiers in combat, engaged the war and registered its tragic aftermath. These films reveal a wounded nation in post-traumatic shock, reeling from a devastating defeat that it never officially acknowledged, let alone accepted.</p><br><p> Kaes uses the term "shell shock"--coined during World War I to describe soldiers suffering from nervous breakdowns--as a metaphor for the psychological wounds that found expression in Weimar cinema. Directors like Robert Wiene, F. W. Murnau, and Fritz Lang portrayed paranoia, panic, and fear of invasion in films peopled with serial killers, mad scientists, and troubled young men. Combining original close textual analysis with extensive archival research, Kaes shows how this post-traumatic cinema of shell shock transformed extreme psychological states into visual expression; how it pushed the limits of cinematic representation with its fragmented story lines, distorted perspectives, and stark lighting; and how it helped create a modernist film language that anticipated film noir and remains incredibly influential today.</p><br><p> A compelling contribution to the cultural history of trauma, <i>Shell Shock Cinema</i> exposes how German film gave expression to the loss and acute grief that lay behind Weimar's sleek fa�ade.</p></p><p><p>"While Weimar psychology took film screening as a metaphor for the replay of World War I trauma under hypnosis, actual movies found relentless metaphors of their own--less as group therapy than in the thrill of referred pain--for a residual war on the nerves. Where Picasso saw cubism in the jigsaw collage of World War I camouflage, Kaes sees in screen montage the jagged forms of combat aftershock. His gripping account is a work of massive historical authority and steady revelation."<b>--Garrett Stewart, author of <i>Framed Time: Toward a Postfilmic Cinema</i></b></p><p>"Siegfried Kracauer initiated the first deeply interpretive history of cinema with his work From Caligari to Hitler, in which he claimed that Weimar cinema presaged the rise of Nazism. Now, in <i>Shell Shock Cinema</i>, Anton Kaes offers a fully researched and equally profound work of film history by moving in the other direction, showing how the fantastic cinema of the Weimar era responded to the most explosive event of modern history--World War I. This is cinema scholarship at its most mature and also most adventuresome."<b>--Tom Gunning, author of <i>The Films of Fritz Lang: Allegories of Vision and Modernity</i></b></p><p>"<i>Shell Shock Cinema</i> is a superb book. It bristles with insights and will be widely read. Anton Kaes is the leading scholar of German film. His book rises far above the usual writing on the subject because of the very extensive knowledge he brings to bear on each of the films, and the highly acute analyses he continually offers. This is cultural scholarship at its very best."<b>--Eric D. Weitz, author of<i> Weimar Germany</i></b></p><p>"With his deep knowledge of German cultural history, Kaes traces how the ghosts of the dead of World War I--the defining trauma of modernity--haunt all major Weimar films. <i>Shell Shock Cinema</i> is a brilliant book about the threshold between the visible and the invisible in post-traumatic narratives, with war memory displaced into stories of madmen, vampires, mythic heroes, and science fiction. In an entirely new key, Weimar cinema reemerges as a paradigm for our post-traumatic times."<b>--Andreas Huyssen, author of <i>Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory</i></b></p><p>"Tony Kaes, an outstanding expert on the Weimar Republic, presents his masterpiece, offering a convincing alternative to Siegfried Kracauer's famous argument. German silent cinema does not prefigure Hitler, but arises from the shell shocks of World War I."<b>--Friedrich Kittler, Humboldt University of Berlin</b></p><p>"Forlornly a woman at the beach looks at the crosses marking the graves surrounding her. Those who return from the front haunt their homes as specters of a lost self, those who remain at home are caught in melancholia, unable to relinquish the loss they know only secondhand. An apt visual motto for these original readings of Weimar cinema, which we will never watch in quite the same way ever again."<b>--Elisabeth Bronfen, author of <i>Crossmappings: Essays on Visual Culture</i></b></p><b>Anton Kaes</b> is the Class of 1939 Professor of German and Film Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

From Louis Armstrong's renegade-style trumpet playing to Sarah Vaughan's operatic crooning, and from the swinging elegance of Duke Ellington to the pioneering experiments of Ornette Coleman, jazz critic Gary Giddins continually astonishes the reader with his unparalleled insight. Writing with the grace and wit that have endeared his prose to <em>Village Voice</em> readers for decades, Giddins also widens the scope of jazz to include such crucial American musicians as Irving Berlin, Rosemary Clooney, and Frank Sinatra, all primarily pop performers who are often dismissed by fans and critics as mere derivatives of the true jazz idiom. And he devotes an entire quarter of this landmark volume to young, still-active jazz artists, boldly expanding the horizons of jazz--and charting and exploring the music's influences as no other book has done.<br></p><p>As Gary Giddins makes clear in his introduction to <i>Visions of Jazz</i>, he's not attempting to draw a canonical line in the sand: "Everyone has his or her vision of jazz, and this is mine." Modesty aside, though, it's hard to imagine a critic with a more encyclopedic grasp of detail, or a more lucid, funny, and appropriately musical style. Weighing in at almost 700 pages, the magnificent <i>Visions of Jazz</i> consists of 70 profiles, beginning with a dual portrait of blackface pioneers Bert Williams and Al Jolson and concluding with the klezmer-infatuated clarinetist Don Byron. These sketches mingle musical, biographical, and cultural insights--indeed, one of Giddins's great gifts is to break down the very distinction between such categories. Yet Giddins is hardly an unhinged generalizer, and he loves to zero in on a particular chorus and disclose its charms on a bar-by-bar basis. The pinnacle of this musical microscopy occurs in his Dizzy Gillespie essay, with an almost biblical exegesis of 64 measures from the 1989 version of "Salt Peanuts." But even in these nuts-and-bolts passages, Giddins is always accessible, combining precisely the right proportions of edification and old-fashioned entertainment. The only problem with <i>Visions of Jazz</i>, in fact, is that it makes you so itchy and impatient to hear the <i>music</i>. Fortunately, Giddins has taken care of the problem by curating a companion disc called (you guessed it) <i>Visions of Jazz</i>. This isn't, it should be said, a predictable journey from one jazz milestone to the next. Instead he's assembled a delightfully idiosyncratic anthology, which testifies to the music's irresistible pulse and all-American parentage. <i>--James Marcus</i><br><strong>Gary Giddins</strong> is the jazz critic for the <em>Village Voice</em>. He lives in New York City.<br></p><h2>The Prentice Hall Editing Workbook</h2><p>This workbook was created to help students gain awareness of common grammatical problems while offering them the tools in which to resolve these errors.

But is this fair and just? Is it ethical for a customer to purchase a digital camera for the sole purpose of using it on a ski trip and then return the item to the store afterwards? Should companies who purchase advertising space on websites that offer pirated videos for download be held accountable for breaking intellectual property laws? The world of business is fraught with ethical challenges. Some of these are relatively straightforward, but others are complicated and require careful reflection. While there are numerous theories to help people navigate these dilemmas, the goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive biblical perspective on contemporary issues in areas such as consumer behavior, management, accounting and marketing. In <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em>, Michael E. Cafferky explores the biblical resources for moral guidance and ethical consideration. He identifies twelve key themes in the narrative of Scripture: cosmic conflict, creation, holiness, covenant relationships, shalom, sabbath, justice, righteousness, truth, wisdom, loving kindness and redemption. By looking at ethical approaches and issues through this multifaceted biblical perspective, Cafferky helps readers appreciate the complex nature of ethical decision making, particularly in the context of business and finance. Designed from the start with the classroom in mind, each chapter of <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> provides example scenarios, questions for intrapersonal and interpersonal ethical reflection, review questions, ethical vignettes for discussion and an exploration of the chapter material in light of the biblical themes. Additional IVP Instructor Resources are also available.</p><p>Michael E. Cafferky (D.B.A., Anderson University) is the Ruth McKee Chair for Entrepreneurship and Business Ethics at Southern Adventist University. He is the author of <em>Management: A Faith-Based Perspective</em> and <em>Breakeven Analysis: The Definitive Guide to Cost-Volume Profit Analysis</em>."Whether taken as a whole or in bite-size pieces, Cafferky's <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em>, offers something for both the novice and the layman. . . . It is an excellent resource book for both instruction and reference. For anyone interested in a deeper understanding of a biblical perspective on ethical issues relevant to our continuously evolving business landscape, Michael E. Cafferky's <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> is a must-read." (Scott Hall, Faithful Lives, Vol. 1, 2016)<br><br>"A complete and exceptionally well organized and presented course of instruction, <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> is an ideal textbook well suited for a business ethics curriculum. In the midst of a new age of Robber Barron Capitalism, <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> is a sorely needed response and should be considered essential reading for all corporate officers, business managers, and entrepreneurs. <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> should be considered a critically important addition to community, corporate, and academic library collections." (Paul T. Vogel, The Midwest Book Review, November 2015)<br><br>"<em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> is more than a basic introduction to business ethics; it?s a distinctly Christian explanation of the topic. . . . <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> should become the standard text in business ethics courses in Christian universities. It also has a place in churches as a tool for discipling those engaged in the business worlds at all levels." (Andrew J. Spencer, The Gospel Coalition, November 30, 2015)<br><br>"Michael Cafferky in <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> has done a yeoman's job in developing a matrix of biblical themes by which to evaluate ethical systems while simultaneously engaging business activities with acumen. By using contemporary examples, case studies, summaries and analyses, and providing review and discussion questions, he guides readers into a holistic personal and corporate engagement with business ethics as both people of business and followers of Christ living within the economic realities of our world. This work will be a resource, a tool and a survey that will be used repeatedly for learners of Christian business (and all believers who live in our world), whether as college students, advanced business practitioners or active embedded citizens of heaven who are interested in truly integrating their faith and life in the pew, the marketplace and the world." (Paul Lewis, Evangel University)<br><br>"Michael Cafferky and InterVarsity Press are to be congratulated on producing such a comprehensive and readable textbook on business ethics from a Christian perspective. It contains a rich diet of biblical wisdom and sound analysis. The biblical story themes, immersion in the nitty gritty and identification of fundamental paradoxes are particularly helpful features of the book." (Richard Higginson, Ridley Hall Theological College, University of Cambridge)<br><br>"Making Christian choices in the web of global economic exchange is no simple matter. This book is a key resource for Christian business practitioners, educators and students who seek faith-based decisions in complex contexts. It recovers relevant Biblical themes and stories, considers conceptual frameworks for business ethics and applies both Scripture and big-picture thinking to on-the-ground business situations. I commend it to those seeking faith-informed foundations for business teaching, learning and decision making." (Shirley J. Roels, senior advisor and director of Network for Vocation in Undergraduate Education)<br><br>"<em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> offers students a clear biblical lens for discerning ethical issues in the marketplace. Well acquainted with both theological ethics and business, author Michael Cafferky adopts a holistic view of mind, heart and action and offers insight from themes in biblical theology. The book provides cogent treatments of all the major ethical approaches and includes perspectives sometimes overlooked, such as common sense. Opportunities for action in consumer behavior, accounting, global business, managing and economic systems are highlighted and a selection of timely cases allows students to engage their heart, mind and practice in a variety of contexts. Cafferky's work is biblical, thorough, practical and recommended." (Monty Lynn, Abilene Christian University)<br><br>"It's rare to find an ethics text that contains both a comprehensive analysis of key moral philosophies and insightful scriptural application to relevant business issues. <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em>, however, offers the best of both in an interesting and engaging format. What's more, the text provides thorough treatment of a broad array of ethical issues in fields like finance, management and marketing that stimulate thinking and encourage evaluation via biblical themes such as shalom, holiness and sabbath. <em>Business Ethics in Biblical Perspective</em> is an excellent resource for current and future businesspeople who want their moral decision-making to honor God." (David Hagenbuch, Messiah College)<br><br>"Michael Cafferky has a distinct advantage over most professors when he writes about business ethics from a biblical perspective: he has spent more than two decades in the trenches of business management. During that time he has had to struggle with the integration of the authority of Scripture in an often messy contemporary marketplace. His thoughtful and thorough discussion will assist any Christian who is serious about honoring God in their business calling." (John E. Stapleford, president, Caesar Rodney Institute, author of Bulls, Bears and Golden Calves)<br><br>"Michael Cafferky has produced a book on the highly relevant topic of business ethics which seeks to incorporate scriptural teaching and scriptural themes in the discussion of ethical decision-making in business."

And such knowledge should be available to all who sincerely desire it, no matter how messed up, no matter how great their sin or crimes. Neither you nor I want to be among those who are banished from heaven because we were on the wrong path. We should welcome, rather than fear, an examination of our convictions. Christ taught that our eternal destiny is dependent on what we believe and on what we do with those beliefs. So we must approach these questions with an open mind and a willingness to learn and have our convictions challenged. Someday many will have our convictions challenged. Someday many will have to admit ruefully that misplaced faith is worse than no faith at all. The question is not whether a path looks good or even feels right. The question is: Is it God&#39;s way, or is it what I think is God&#39;s way? Stay tuned. Five minutes after you die you will either have had your first glimpse of heaven with its euphoria and bliss or your first genuine experience of unrelenting horror and regret. Either way, you future will be irrevocably fixed and eternally unchangeable. In those first moments, you will be more alive than you ever have been. Vivid memories of your friends and your life on planet earth will be mingled with a daunting anticipation of eternity. You will have had you first direct glimpse of Christ or your first encounter with evil as you have never known it.

When most people see advertisements by forex brokers, their eyes start to widen on the offers of high leverage and the possibility of tremendous returns. It is attractive and almost irresistible. However, even though currencies can provide attractive returns, leverage is a sharp double-edged sword. High returns come with high risks, which can be suitable for some but not all investors. Currencies are a great asset class for people looking to diversify their portfolios. And throughout the year, currency values can increase or decrease anywhere between 5 to 25 percent. With U.S. Treasuries yielding next to nothing and our bank accounts earning only a few cents on the dollar, most of us would be satisfied with 5 percent, let alone 25 percent return. There is no need to use excessive leverage - taking it slow and easy increases the chance of seeing your account grow. <br><br> Over the past 10 years, the forex market has evolved significantly and competition has brought many benefits to new forex traders. Most forex brokers will offer free education and practice accounts, and new traders should take advantage of them because the most effective way of making money in the currency market is learning how the market works and to practice, practice, practice before dumping significant capital into a live account. <br><br> From a more practical perspective, there is no need for monogamy when it comes to trading currencies. Take the best of both worlds and combine both fundamental and technical analysis. <i>The Little Book of Currency Trading</i> will teach you how to identify the big stories affecting currencies and how to pinpoint places to enter and exit your trades. You may know more about currencies than you actually think. If you have ever traveled to another country or if you love to read about political or economic developments abroad, then you have already gotten a taste of what moves currencies. Start by trading what you know, and at the onset, bank your profits when you have them to build your confidence and your knowledge of how the currency market moves. <br><br> <b> What indicators or economic data should investors monitor to identify a potential profit opportunity in the currency market? </b><br> News moves the markets and economic data is a consistent event risk that can provide daily trading opportunities by driving meaningful moves in a currency. However not all economic releases are equally important, and it is essential to be able to delineate between what will and will not move the currency. As a rule of thumb, put yourself into the shoes of a central bank -- whatever the central bank watches is typically what can move the currency because it can help determine whether the central bank will raise or lower interest rates. This includes employment, retail sales and inflation reports. The best trades are the ones that are also aligned with the current prevailing trend and sentiment in the foreign exchange, something that the <i>Little Book</i> will teach you how to do. <br><br> <b>What is the learning process for an individual investor -- who already has experience trading stocks -- in the currency market? </b><br> Trade what you know. If you trade stocks using technical analysis, you can do the same in the currency market. In fact, technical analysis is one of the most popular ways to analyze currencies. It will be important to learn about the unique characteristics of the market, including round the clock trading and general trading mechanics. But after that, you can use Fibonacci retracements the same way you do in equities in currencies. For traders who love to follow developments in Europe or Asia -- once again, trade what you know. If you travel to London often and have a good idea of how the U.K. economy is doing, your outlook can be translated into a currency trade. The same is true for traders who have an opinion on whether the Eurozone will go bust due to their debt crisis. Currencies just offer another vehicle to express the views that as stock traders, you may already have. <br><br> <b>Historically, the currency market often produces long-term trends that provide a great opportunity for profit. Do you think that will continue in the years ahead? </b> <br> Currencies have been around for hundreds of years in one form or another and are little confidence measures of a country. If you believe that business cycles repeat themselves -- with expansion followed by contraction and contraction followed by expansion -- then the long term trends of currencies will continue to be evident because the optimism or pessimism of investors usually follows the business cycles of each country. The reason why currencies have had such strong trends in the past few decades is because in general, the outlook for a country gets progressively better or worse, and this dynamic is reflected in the value of the currency. Using a unique easy to understand tool, the <i>Little Book</i> will show you unique ways to join the trend and minimize the risk of chasing a move that quickly fades. <br></p><p>Once dominated by global banks, hedge funds, and multinational corporations, the foreign exchange market, or forex, is now easily accessible to traders and investors around the world. But in order to make the most of your time in this market, you need to have a firm understanding of how it works. <p>Written by forex expert Kathy Lien, <i>The Little Book of Currency Trading</i> shows you how to effectively trade and invest in today's biggest market.

Garrett also exposes the ungoverned world of biological terrorism.</p><p>What do Russia, Zaire, Los Angeles, and--most likely--your community have in common? Each is woefully unprepared to deal with a major epidemic, whether it's caused by bioterrorism or by new or reemerging diseases resistant to antibiotics. After the publication of her critically acclaimed <i>The Coming Plague</i>, which looked at the reemergence of infectious diseases, Laurie Garrett decided to turn her highly honed reportorial skills to what she saw as the only solution--not medical technology, but public health. However, what she found in her travels was the collapse of public-health systems around the world, no comfort to a species purportedly sitting on a powder keg of disease. In <i>Betrayal of Trust</i>, Garrett exposes the shocking weaknesses in our medical system and the ramifications of a world suddenly much smaller, yet still far apart when it comes to wealth and attention to health.<p> With globalization, humans are more vulnerable to outbreaks from any part of the world; increasingly, the health of each nation depends on the health of all. Yet public health has been pushed down the list of priorities. In India, an outbreak of bubonic plague created international hysteria, ridiculous in an age when the plague can easily be treated with antibiotics--that is, if you have a public-health system in place. India, busy putting its newfound wealth elsewhere, didn't. In Zaire, the deadly Ebola virus broke out in a filthy and completely unequipped hospital, and would have kept up its rampage if the organization Doctors Without Borders hadn't stepped in, not with high-tech equipment or drugs, but with soap, protective gear, and clean water. Most of the world still doesn't have access to these basic public-health necessities. The 15 states of the former Soviet Union have seen the most astounding collapse in public health in the industrialized world. But during a cholera epidemic, officials refused to use the simple cure public-health workers have long relied on--oral rehydration therapy. Many of the problems in these nations can also be found in one degree or another in the U.S., where medical cures using expensive technology and drugs have been emphasized to the detriment of protecting human health. The result? More than 100,000 Americans die each year from infections caught in hospitals, and America has a disease safety net full of holes.</p><p> A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist (for <i>Newsday</i> and others), Garrett has deftly turned what could have been a very dry subject into dramatic reportage, beginning with the eerie silence on the streets of Surat, India, where half the city's population (including doctors) fled the plague, while a thick white layer of DDT powdered the ground. Fascinating, frightening, and well-documented, <i>Betrayal of Trust</i> should be read not only by medical professionals and policymakers but the general public, and should galvanize a change in thinking and priorities. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Laurie Garrett is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has been a health and science writer for Newsday since 1988, and a contributor to such publications as Vanity Fair, Esquire, The Los Angeles Times, and Foreign Affairs.

Experts in the media, medical science, and government alike are scrambling to find answers. What or who is responsible for this fat crisis, and what can we do to stop it?<br><br>Abigail Saguy argues that these fraught and frantic debates obscure a more important question: How has fatness come to be understood as a public health crisis at all? Why, she asks, has the view of "fat" as a problem-a symptom of immorality, a medical pathology, a public health epidemic-come to dominate more positive framings of weight-as consistent with health, beauty, or a legitimate rights claim-in public discourse? Why are heavy individuals singled out for blame? And what are the consequences of understanding weight in these ways?<br><br><em>What's Wrong with Fat?</em> presents each of the various ways in which fat is understood in America today, examining the implications of understanding fatness as a health risk, disease, and epidemic, and revealing why we've come to understand the issue in these terms, despite considerable scientific uncertainty and debate. Saguy shows how debates over the relationship between body size and health risk take place within a larger, though often invisible, contest over whether we should understand fatness as obesity at all. Moreover, she reveals that public discussions of the "obesity crisis" do more harm than good, leading to bullying, weight-based discrimination, and misdiagnoses. <br><br>Showing that the medical framing of fat is literally making us sick, <em>What's Wrong with Fat?</em> provides a crucial corrective to our society's misplaced obsession with weight.<br></p><p><br><strong>Abigail C. Saguy</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology and of Gender Studies at UCLA. She is the author of <em>What Is Sexual Harassment? From Capitol Hill to the Sorbonne </em>(University of California Press, 2003).<br><br>"Fascinating and illuminating." --<em>The New York Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"Abigail Saguy asks the kinds of questions that can shift scientific paradigms, challenge prejudice, and promote social justice for people of all sizes. She backs up her clear-headed analysis of mainstream belief systems with carefully conducted research that reveals the inherent linkage between how we think about weight and how such beliefs shape not only health, but also lives and society. Anyone who's stepped on a scale or seen a media report about the so-called obesity epidemic will benefit from exploring What's Wrong with Fat?" --Marilyn Wann, author of <em>FAT!SO?</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this pathbreaking book, Abigail Saguy explores the social implications of viewing fatness as a public health crisis. Saguy's conclusions challenge conventional understandings of obesity as a moral and medical problem and draws attention to the debilitating consequences of weight-based stigma. This book is essential reading for anyone concerned about public policy and cultural consciousness on matters affecting weight." --Deborah L. Rhode, author of <em>The Beauty Bias</em> <br><p></p><br>"'What's wrong?' is the most basic question we can ask about a social problem. At first glance, the answer may seem obvious. But Abigail Saguy's careful analysis of contemporary claims about fat reveals that it's a question that can be answered in many competing ways, and any apparent consensus is rooted in particular times, places, and social arrangements. This book invites us to think, not just about fat, but about other weighty issues." --Joel Best, author of <em>Everyone's a Winner</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>What's Wrong with Fat?</em> excels at something sociology can do quite well-displace simple answers with a razor-sharp questioning of the question. In this lucid and comprehensive account, Saguy teases apart the different threads of contemporary discourse about obesity and investigates the potent real-world consequences of our competing ways of thinking about this social, moral, and medical issue. She reveals the meanings of fatness to be about much more than calories: they are shaped by social processes used to determine biomedical truth, and they are intertwined with the often-divisive politics of race, class, sexuality, gender, culture, and nationality. Highly recommended for people of any size or shape!" --Steven Epstein, author of <em>Inclusion: The Politics of Difference in Medical Research</em> <br><p></p><br>"Being fat is bad for you. Being discriminated against because you are fat may be even worse. In this eye-opening book, Saguy shows that the war on obesity is really a war on fat people that targets women, minorities, and the poor. Social inequality-not body mass-is killing people. Saguy reveals the hidden interests behind the so-called obesity epidemic." <br>--Christine Williams, Professor of Sociology, University of Texas at Austin <br><p></p><br>"Provocative, thoughtful and thorough." --<em>NatureR </em><br><p></p><br>"Written with clarity and passion, this mind-expanding work invites readers to consider the rights of people at any size. An insightful, profoundly nonbiased, must read for anyone in public health/medicine, nutrition/dietetics, public policy, journalism, education, counseling, and social work. Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>What's Wrong with Fat?</em> is a well-written, carefully researched book that contributes an essential perspective on body size that will appeal to a wide range of scholars and activists. It is a bellwether in the growth of the interdisciplinary field of fat studies yet firmly grounded in sociological theory and methodology. ...Saguy's work will continue to push scholarship on health, weight, and size as well as on gender, race, class, and inequality." --<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Shelly Cashman Series Microsoft Office 365 &amp; Access2019 Comprehensive (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Introduce your students to the latest advancements that Microsoft Office and Access have to offer with MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 &amp; ACCESS 2019: COMPREHENSIVE -- new to the acclaimed Shelly Cashman Series.

Melville unfolds the story of an idealistic young man whose steadfast beliefs lead him to destroy his world and himself.<br></p><p>This Kraken Edition of Pierre, or The Ambiguities is a reconstruction of the text that Melville delivered to Harper &amp; Brothers early in January 1852, just as some of the most devastating reviews of Moby-Dick were appearing. The Harper brothers apparently decided that Pierre was even more outrageous than Moby-Dick and tried to avoid publishing it by offering Melville less than half the royalties they had paid for his previous books. Accepting the humiliating contract, Melville took a self-destructive revenge. After Book XVI, he interpolated a new section on "Young America in Literature", in which he arbitrarily announced that his hero, Pierre, had been a juvenile author. Melville proceeded to add an intrusive "Pierre as author" sub-plot, disparaging American literary life and the world of publishing, which he left unassimilated into the book he had first completed. Melville scholar Hershel Parker has long believed that the psychological stature of Moby-Dick would best be understood in the light of the original, shorter version of Pierre, in his opinion "surely the finest psychological novel anyone had yet written in English". Moby-Dick and the reconstructed Pierre are at last revealed as complexly interlinked companion studies of the moods of thought - the Typee and Omoo of depth psychology. Furthermore, all Melville lovers will be challenged by Maurice Sendak's extraordinary pictures, which constitute a brilliantly provocative interpretation of Melville's study of moral and mental ambiguities.<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 &#x2013; September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>The Library of Congress Civil War Desk Reference</h2><p>A single-volume resource contains a timeline of the war; biographies of important figures; listings of major campaigns and battles; coverage of political and social movements during Antebellum, wartime, and Reconstruction periods; and a resource guide for further research. 35,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Magaret E.

The fate of the nation and of slavery hung in the balance, and the resolution affects America today. Following the popular desk reference format, this work provides a thematic approach to the war.<p>Beginning with the antebellum period, the 13 chapters cover topics such as "Wartime Politics," "Battles and Battlefields," "Medical Care and Medicine," "The Home Front," and "The Civil War in Literature and the Arts." Most chapters include a chronology, and these, although somewhat repetitive, help place events in proper order. Although the maps are sometimes a bit hard to read (such as "Seven Days Battles," which is jammed with information), they do help in understanding troop location, topography, and movements. A section on mapmaking illustrates the importance to both armies. The chapters end with bibliographies of sources, and a massive bibliography provides even more resources.</p><p>The final chapter, "Studying the War: Research and Preservation," is especially noteworthy in its comprehensive approach. Anyone wanting to find information on books, people, monuments, battlefields, organizations, or reenactments will find a starting point here. Both print and electronic resources are included.</p><p><i>Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History </i>(ABC-CLIO, 2000) is more comprehensive. But <i>Civil War Desk Reference</i>, with its solid scholarship, informative approach, and broad sweep, is an excellent source for school, academic, and public libraries that cannot afford the five-volume set or need a one-volume supplemental source.

After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected ships instantly became the U-boats&#x2019; prime targets. And they were easy targets&#x2014;the Navy lacked the inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of 1943. Hitler was determined that his U-boats should sink every American ship they could find, sometimes within sight of tourist beaches, and to kill as many mariners as possible, in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore. <br><br>As the war progressed, men from Mathews sailed the North and South Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and even the icy Barents Sea in the Arctic Circle, where they braved the dreaded Murmansk Run. Through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to every danger zone, in every kind of ship. Some died horrific deaths. Others fought to survive torpedo explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseys&#x2014;only to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.<br><i><br>The Mathews Men</i> shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefields&#x2014;often the U.S. merchant mariners&#x2019; life-and-death struggles took place just off the U.S. coast&#x2014;but also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to the Pacific. &#x201c;When final victory is ours,&#x201d; General Dwight D. Eisenhower had predicted, &#x201c;there is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.&#x201d; Here, finally, is the heroic story of those merchant seamen, recast as the human story of the men from Mathews.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2016:</strong> When the United States entered WWII, it was still in the process of building up its naval fleet to take on the enemy at sea. Much of the early burden was placed on the merchant marine, which moved cargo and personnel, essentially unprotected, through the initial period of the war. Author William Geroux has produced a well-constructed and meticulously researched account of the heroics performed and sacrifices endured by the merchant marine, focusing on the Chesapeake Bay county of Mathews, Virginia. As Geroux writes, &#x201c;For more than 250 years, the profession of choice in Mathews had been sailing merchant ships.&#x201d; These men, including the Hodges family, which sent seven sons to war, performed an essential but underreported service for the country.

As a nonprofit 501(c)(3), EEK works across the country to provide essential resources for parents and educators to teach children and teenagers about the dangers of online pornography and simple, straight forward solutions for talking about its opposite: healthy sexual intimacy. EEK believes that online pornography consumption among children and teens is reaching epidemic proportions and is one of the most perilous public health issues of our time. With children being exposed at younger and younger ages, porn addiction rates are sky-rocketing, body image and self esteem among both genders continues to plummet and rape culture thrives. In an effort to combat these issues, EEK has written 30 Days of Sex Talks, created valuable online content (educateempowerkids.org), and currently performs in-school and community presentations for children and parents. It is our goal that parents, therapists, community leaders and the general public come to understand and work together to contain the deleterious effects of an entire generation who receives its sexual education from online pornography.<p>"As a Marriage and Family Therapist, I work with many children and adolescents who struggle to understand appropriate sexual behavior. Today's media centric culture makes teaching healthy sexual boundaries even more difficult than ever before. This book is a great way to address healthy sexuality, without the fear that many parents have about moralizing. Using this book as a starting point is a comfortable and helpful way to get these important concepts into the conversation with your children. This is an excellent tool for both professionals and parents."--Amazon Customer</p><p>"t can be so very difficult for parents to address the various issues around sex, social media and more. The "30 Days of Sex Talks" series provides a helpful checklist that parents can readily follow to completely discuss sex and associated issues with their kids. I love the empowerment this series gives to parents by encouraging them to be the primary deliverers of sex talk messaging. The important notion that these are not "one and done" conversations are supported in this and the other books in this series. The age-appropriate material helps parents address issues kids face... and have questions about. Thank you Dina Alexander and the rest of the editorial team for producing these oh-so-helpful books for parents!!!!" --Ginger Kadlec, Child's World America &amp; Be a Kid's Hero Founder</p><p>"Great to have a resource for parents!! Sex education is taught at school is merely the biology side of sex, what about the relationship part, the intimacy and connection aspects of sex. What about the positive and possibly negative consequences? This book has been a great jumping off point for my husband and I to launch into our own conversations that now happen easyily throughout our daily life as questions or thoughts arise. We no longer need the book, it served more as a catalyst to begin. I think if kids find parents comfortable they they will be comfortable returning to ask questions or talk about sexual things but if we are uncomfortable squirmish, they will be that way with us and won't want to repeat the experience. This book helped me find my confidence and talk to my kids in a comfortable way!

She was arrested on the charge of witchcraft in June of 1663. She was found guilty and was executed on December 30th that same year. Her trial was long and involved, with many witnesses from several towns and villages. </p><br><br><p>Consisting of direct translations of the trial testimony, <i>The Trial of Tempel Anneke </i>portrays a large and varied cast of characters including trades people, farmers, local nobility, village drunkards, and Tempel Anneke herself. Tempel Anneke was in several ways typical of those accused of witchcraft, yet from the testimony she emerges as a complex and controversial figure. She was literate and owned a few books and herbals; she prided herself on her medical and pharmaceutical knowledge and until the final stages of the trial when her confession was extracted under torture, she was sharp, assertive, and even witty in her responses to questioning. This English translation offers direct archival insight into the workings of 17th century law, contemporary understandings of justice, perceptions of natural and magical causes, and above all, the social history of the period.</p><br><br><p>While other witchcraft materials exist, this is the only text available in English that allows students to follow a witchcraft&nbsp;trial from beginning to end. Highly readable, this astonishing narrative is perfectly suited to being read as a complete document. The useful additions of introduction, appendices, glossary, and index provide readers with important background information so that they can engage directly with the material.</p></p><p><b>Peter A. Morton </b> is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Humanities at Mount Royal University.<br> <b>Barbara D�hms </b>is a translator.'Most, if not all, readers will come to this book seeking accurate information about a trial that deals with an event and a mindset very distant from our own. The translation offers exactly that: it affords us a glimpse at the judicial and legal complexities that governed this witch trial, the interrogations, and the final prosecution of the accused. Helpful footnotes shed light on some of the more obscure procedures, provide names not immediately familiar, and enlighten us about unfamiliar colloquialisms. All this makes the book an excellent primary source for undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as for scholars who may not have access to the archive or who cannot read German.' (<em>Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft</em>)<br><br>'Peter A. Morton's edition of the papers relating to [Tempel Anneke's] case, which are ably translated by Barbara Dahms, provides an excellent insight into how the dynamics of a witch-trial operated. The subject matter is not sensationalized, and, as Morton makes clear in his introduction, <em>The Trial of Tempel Anneke </em>is not going to revolutionalize our understanding of the European witch-hunts. But the reader willing to stay with the texts of Anneke's trial will be left with a clear impression of how suspicions could build against a supposed witch, how the evidence of witnesses demonstrated that witchcraft and magic were firmly imbricated in the popular culture of the period, and how the accused witch would find her certainty in her innocence destabilized and eroded, a process aided by but not entirely attributable to torture.' (<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>)</p><h2>Attending: Medicine, Mindfulness, and Humanity</h2><p>The first book for the general public about mindfulness and medical practice, a groundbreaking, intimate exploration of how doctors think and what matters most&#x2014;safe, effective, patient-centered, compassionate care&#x2014;from the foremost expert in the field.<br><br>As a third-year Harvard Medical School student doing a clinical rotation in surgery, Ronald Epstein watched an error unfold: an experienced surgeon failed to notice his patient&#x2019;s kidney turning an ominous shade of blue. In that same rotation, Epstein was awestruck by another surgeon&#x2019;s ability to avert an impending disaster, slowing down from autopilot to intentionality. The difference between these two doctors left a lasting impression on Epstein and set the stage for his life&#x2019;s work&#x2014;to identify the qualities and habits that distinguish masterful doctors from those who are merely competent. The secret, he learned, was mindfulness.<br> <br>In <i>Attending</i>, his first book, Dr. Epstein builds on his world-renowned, innovative programs in mindful practice and uses gripping and deeply human clinical stories to give patients a language to describe what they value most in health care and to outline a road map for doctors and other health care professionals to refocus their approach to medicine. Drawing on his clinical experiences and current research, and exploring four foundations of mindfulness&#x2014;Attention, Curiosity, Beginner&#x2019;s Mind, and Presence&#x2014;Dr. Epstein introduces a revolutionary concept: by looking inward, health care practitioners can grow their capacity to provide high-quality care and the resilience to be there when their patients need them.<br> <br>The commodification of health care has shifted doctors&#x2019; focus away from the healing of patients to the bottom line. Clinician burnout is at an all-time high. <i>Attending</i> is the antidote. With compassion and intelligence, Epstein offers a crucial, timely book that shows us how we can restore humanity to medicine, guides us toward a better overall quality of care, and reminds us of what matters most.</p><p>Dr. Ronald Epstein is a practicing family physician and professor of family medicine, psychiatry, and oncology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, where he directs the Center for Communication and Disparities Research. He is an internationally recognized educator, writer, and researcher whose landmark article, &#x201c;Mindful Practice,&#x201d; published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> in 1999, has revolutionized physicians&#x2019; view of their work. Dr. Epstein has been named one of America&#x2019;s Best Doctors every year since 1998 by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. Visit Dr. Epstein at RonaldEpstein.com.&#x201c;This book is phenomenal, and will be phenomenally useful to physicians and to all of us who are desperately in need of true health care and caring. It is hard for me to imagine a doctor reading it and not immediately recognizing, taking to heart, and implementing its messages in any number of different ways, being so commonsensical, clear, innately transformative, and healing. And it is equally hard for me to imagine that it will not energize all of us, when we find ourselves in the role of &#x2018;the patient,&#x2019; to demand greater mindfulness from our care-givers across the board, and know what we mean by that.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i> and <i>Mindfulness for Beginners</i> </b><br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;As a student admissions committee member reviewing Ron Epstein's application to medical school, I knew he was special, a view surpassed by his visionary achievements illuminating the important nature of how physicians care for their patients, and how they can best care for themselves. <i>Attending </i>is the book every medical caregiver needs to strengthen their minds and harness their resilience to care for others&#x2014;and every patient needs to understand how doctors think.&nbsp;This is a work of heart and head, a beautiful synthesis of inner wisdom and hard earned scientific empirical findings that point the way to proven methods for improving the lives of both giver and receiver of medical care.&nbsp; With clear explanations, captivating stories, and well-described challenges and approaches to their solutions, this book is exactly what the field of medicine needs.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Daniel J.

Books in this new, illustrated series present complete texts of Shakespeare's plays. However, the lines are set up so students can see the bard's original poetic phrases printed side-by-side and line-by-line with a modern "translation" on the facing page.<br><br> Starting in the late 1580s and for several decades that followed, Shakespeare's plays were popular entertainment for London's theatergoers. His Globe Theatre was the equivalent of a Broadway theater in today's New York. The plays have endured, but over the course of 400+ years, the English language has changed in many ways&#x2014;which is why today's students often find Shakespeare's idiom difficult to comprehend. <br><br><i>Simply Shakespeare</i> offers an excellent solution to their problem. Introducing each play is a general essay covering Shakespeare's life and times. At the beginning of each of the five acts in every play, a two-page spread describes what is about to take place. The story's background is explained, followed by brief descriptions of key people who will appear in the act, details students should watch for as the story unfolds, discussion of the play's historical context, how the play was staged in Shakespeare's day, and explanation of puns and plays on words that occur in characters' dialogues.<br><br> Identifying icons preceding each of these study points are printed in a second color, then are located again as cross-references in the play's original text. For instance, where words spoken by a person in the play offer insights into his or another character's personality, the "Characters" icon will appear as a cross-reference in both the introductory spread and the play proper. Following each act, a closing spread presents questions and discussion points for use as teachers' aids. Guided by the inspiring format of this fine new series, both teachers and students will come to understand and appreciate the genius of Shakespeare as never before.</p><p>Professor Spevack&#39;s critical discussion shows how private desires and public affairs are inextricable in Julius Caesar and how Shakespeare frames the world of this play - person, action, place, time - within the operations of larger forces, mysterious, ironical, and undeniable.In this striking tragedy of political conflict, Shakespeare turns to the ancient Roman world and to the famous assassination of Julius Caesar by his republican opponents. The play is one of tumultuous rivalry, of prophetic warnings--&#34;Beware the ides of March&#34;--and of moving public oratory &#34;Friends, Romans, countrymen!&#34; Ironies abound and most of all for Brutus, whose fate it is to learn that his idealistic motives for joining the conspiracy against a would-be dictator are not enough to sustain the movement once Caesar is dead.</p><h2>Crc Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 55ED</h2><p>56th Edition 1975-1976. &#34;A Ready-Reference Book of Chemical and Physical Data&#34;.

Faced with the threat of bankruptcy, he concludes that the only way to escape his frustrating existence is by burning his shop to the ground, and killing himself. Unexpected events, however, conspire at the last moment to lead the bewildered Mr Polly to a bright new future - after he saves a life, fakes his death, and escapes to a life of heroism, hope and ultimate happiness.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Fans of H.G. Wells's famous, genre-spawning science fiction novels may be startled to read his less-remembered but once bestselling <i>The History of Mr. Polly</i>. Its comically romping narrative voice is worlds away from the stern, melancholy tone of <i>The Time Machine</i>. Wells won fame for his apocalyptic, preachy books about the history of the future, but this history is strictly, as Mr. Polly would put it in his creatively cracked version of English, a series of "little accidentulous misadventures." <p> Mr. Alfred Polly is a dyspeptic, miserably married shopkeeper in what he terms that "<i>Beastly</i> Silly Wheeze of a hole!"--Fishbourne, England. He is inclined to spark arguments and slapstick calamity wherever he goes. Education was lost on him: when he left school at 14, "his mind was in much the same state that you would be in, dear reader, if you were operated upon for appendicitis by a well-meaning, boldly enterprising, but rather overworked and underpaid butcher boy, who was superseded towards the climax of the operation by a left-handed clerk of high principles but intemperate habits... the operators had left, so to speak, all their sponges and ligatures in the mangled confusion." Still, Polly's mind burns with eccentric genius, and his thwarted romantic heart beats him senseless. His despair results in the most amusing suicide attempt this side of Lisa Alther's novel <i>Kinflicks</i>. We won't spoil the surprise by saying precisely how his scheme misfires--and beware: the introduction gives it away. Note that you can't expect Polly to do anything right, and of course he'll become an inadvertent hero to the whole town. Then he promptly vanishes for further misadventure.</p><p> Many critics compare <i>Mr. Polly</i>'s broad social satire to Dickens, but it smacks of Mark Twain and the dialect humor of Finley Peter Dunne's <i>Mr. Dooley</i> too. "I think it is one of my good books," Wells opined. What makes it so is Polly's heroic incompetence, his subversion of Edwardian propriety, and his bewildered unawareness that he is a revolutionary. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

He knew that though history doesn't repeat, not exactly, history is an excellent guide for investors. <p>In <i>Markets Never Forget But People Do: How Your Memory Is Costing You Money and Why This Time Isn't Different</i>, long-time Forbes columnist, CEO of Fisher Investments, and 4-time New York Times bestselling author Ken Fisher shows how and why investors' memories fail them&#x2014;and how costly that can be. More important, he shows steps investors can take to begin reducing errors they repeatedly make. The past is never indicative of the future, but history can be one powerful guide in shaping forward looking expectations. Readers can learn how to see the world more clearly&#x2014;and learn to make fewer errors&#x2014;by understanding just a bit of investing past.</p></p><p><br> <br> <strong> Q&amp;A with Author Ken Fisher</strong> <br><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Ken Fisher</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br> <b>You start the book with Sir Templeton&#x2019;s famous quote, "The four most expensive words in the English language are, ;This time it&#x2019;s different.'" Is "this time" ever different? </b><br> History doesn't repeat, not exactly. And the past cannot predict the future, but it is one good tool in determining if something is reasonable to expect. Investing is a probabilities game, not a certainties game. Nothing is certain in investing&#x2014;all you can do is determine what a range of reasonable probabilities are. <br><br> In the same way, it's not a possibilities game. It&#x2019;s possible the world gets hit by an asteroid and destroys life as we know it, but the far greater probability is no such terrible thing happens. <br><br> You can't develop a portfolio strategy around endless possibilities. You wouldn't even get out of bed if you considered everything that could possibly happen. Instead, as I show in the book, you can use history as one tool for shaping reasonable probabilities. Then, you look at the world of economic, sentiment and political drivers to determine what's most likely to happen&#x2014;while always knowing you can be and will be wrong a lot. <br><br> <b>You say bull markets are inherently above average. How so? </b><br> I interact with a lot of investors. And, amazingly, even many professionals don't get this&#x2014;bull market returns are inherently above average. Most people get that long-term, stocks average between 9% and 10%. But that&#x2019;s an average and bakes in big up years and big down years. <br><br> I show in the book annual bull market returns on average have about doubled the market&#x2019;s long-term annual average. And early bull market returns historically have been even bigger. All that means is long-term investors can and should expect to experience downside. But if you&#x2019;re long-term growth oriented and remain disciplined to a good strategy appropriate for you, downside gets swamped by the bigger and longer periods of market upside. <br><br> Stocks rise much more than they fall&#x2014;I show this in the book. Yet people focus much more on downside, so they forget. <br><br> <b>You say "ideology is deadly" in investing, but don't a lot of people prefer one political party over another? </b><br> Sure. Personally, I don't cotton to either major party. But most people do tend to have one party they like. That&#x2019;s fine and normal. Where it becomes problematic is letting your party preference color your market views. Then, too, there are some profitable patterns investors may miss if they are blinded by ideology and don&#x2019;t use history to overcome that. <br><br> One example, in 2012, we either re-elect Obama, a Democrat, or newly elect a Republican. If you have a strong alliance to one party or the other, you likely think it's good if your guy wins, but bad if the other guy wins. But if you check history, you know either outcome has typically been good for stocks. When we re-elect a Democrat, stocks have averaged 14.5%, but when we newly elect a Republican, they average 18.8% in the election year. I explain why in the book. <br><br> People's ideology blinds them. And because they don't remember even recent history, they don't remember this major pattern happening right in front of them. <br><br> <b>Right now, many fear the next 10 years may end up looking like the 2000s, overall pretty flat. What do you say to people concerned about a "lost decade"? </b><br> They are fearful of something that&#x2019;s never happened before in the US, not once. Those are bad odds to bet on. <br><br> First, making a forecast for a 10-year period ahead is close to impossible. In the book, I explain why. But briefly, in the near term, demand is the primary driver of stock prices because supply doesn&#x2019;t move enough to matter. Longer term, supply shifts swamp everything else. And you can't make a 10-year forecast unless you know something about where stock supply will head 8, 9 and 10 years from now. I've never seen anyone even begin to address that. <br><br> Most important, flat or down 10-year periods for US stocks are historically rare. Then, too, every single 10-year period that followed was not only positive, but strongly positive. Can you get two back-to-back negative 10-year periods? Sure&#x2014;but you better have a darn good reason why the period ahead will so strongly buck the odds. And you better have some new technology for forecasting 10-year returns because I&#x2019;ve never seen one that has worked consistently. <br> <br>Why do so many investors make the same mistakes repeatedly&#x2014;being too bullish or too bearish at just the wrong times? Because they forget. Forgetting pain is an instinct&#x2014;humans have evolved that way to better cope with the problems of survival. But for the complex and often counterintuitive world of investing, it causes serious errors. <p>"This time it's different" are the four most expensive words in the English language (according to investing legend Sir John Templeton). Yet many investors routinely fall into the trap of thinking "now" (whenever "now" is) is different somehow. In <i>Markets Never Forget (But People Do): How Your Memory Is Costing You Money&#x2014;and Why This Time Isn't Different</i>, four-time <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Ken Fisher shows readers how their memories play (often costly) tricks on them&#x2014;and how they can combat their faulty memories with just a bit of history.</p> <p>This isn't to say history repeats itself perfectly. It doesn't&#x2014;but a recession is a recession. Some are vastly worse than others&#x2014;but investors have lived through them before. Credit crises aren't new, nor are bear markets&#x2014;or bull markets. Geopolitical tension is as old as mankind, as is war and even terrorist attacks. Understanding how investors have reacted to similar past events can help guide investors in shaping better forward-looking expectations. The past never predicts the future, but it can reduce guesswork about what's ahead.</p> <p>In this book, Fisher takes aim at some major market memory mishaps&#x2014;like the idea stocks have become inherently more volatile or that wildly above- or below-average returns are abnormal. He shows how, early in every recovery, investors don't believe in it&#x2014;often at a huge cost. And he shows how, in investing, ideology is deadly. Most important, he teaches how you can use history as one powerful tool to help begin reducing your error rate and help begin getting better investing results.</p></p><h2>The Metropolis of Tomorrow (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>In 1916, New York City enacted zoning laws that mandated the building of &#x201c;set-back&#x201d; structures so that light and air would be more freely admitted into the streets below. This concept was first proposed by Louis Sullivan in his 1891 article, &#x201c;The High-Building Question&#x201d; (inspired by William Le Baron Jenney&#x2019;s recently completed Manhattan Building in Chicago.) Hugh Ferriss (1889-1962), American draftsman and architect, studied architecture at Washington University in St. Louis where the Beaux Arts school was favored. Early in his career he worked as a draftsman in the office of Cass Gilbert until he became a freelance delineator. In 1922, Ferris took part in a series of zoning envelope studies that sought to comply with the earlier city legislation. Such were the key ingredients that gave rise to the book at hand.<br>In <i>The Metropolis of Tomorrow,</i> 49 stunning illustrations depict towering structures, personal space, wide avenues, and rooftop parks &#x2014; features that now exist in many innovative, densely populated urban landscapes. Ferriss uses metaphors from nature that lend his text a poetic quality. It is no wonder that the work inspired critics of the time to remark: &#x201c;As a creative entity, as a symbol of the American spirit, it is superb&#x201d; (<i>Survey</i>), and as &#x201c;magically stirring as a prophecy&#x201d; (Albert Guerard in <i>Books</i>).<br>With its eloquent commentary and powerful renderings, <i>The Metropolis of Tomorrow</i> is an indispensable resource for students, architects, and anyone else with an interest in American architecture.</p><p>In this 1929 volume, Ferriss presented his vision of how he believes the cities of tomorrow (which now are those of today) would look. Ferriss's specialty was skyscrapers, and the 108 illustrations here feature monstrous buildings, many of which came to fruition. Though basically black-and-white drawings of buildings, the plates are often extremely beautiful.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Princeton Architectural Press should be applauded for rescuing this book and making it available to a wide audience. <strong>Scott Gutterman, <i>Architectural Record</i></strong><br><br> A book like this lives or dies by the quality of the drawings.

Part I describes questions and issues about mathematics that have motivated philosophers since the beginning of intellectual history. Part II is an historical survey, discussing the role of mathematics in the thought of such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Mill. Part III covers the three major positions held throughout the twentieth century: the idea that mathematics is logic (logicism), the view that the essence of mathematics is the rule-governed manipulation of characters (formalism), and a revisionist philosophy that focuses on the mental activity of mathematics (intuitionism). Finally, Part IV brings the reader up-to-date with a look at contemporary developments within the discipline. <br><br>This sweeping introductory guide to the philosophy of mathematics makes these fascinating concepts accessible to those with little background in either mathematics or philosophy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stewart Shapiro</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Ohio State University at Newark and Professorial Fellow in the Department of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.<br>&#34;Stewart Shapiro admirably provides an accessible introduction to contemporary thinking in mathematics, while avoiding caricature of the technicalities.

Subordinate themes include the parallels between Joshua and Moses; the tension between complete and incomplete fulfillment of God&#39;s promise regarding the land and &#34;rest&#34;; the participation of &#34;all Israel&#34;; the people&#39;s fear and God&#39;s reassurance; God&#39;s revelation; commemoration of the &#34;giving&#34; of the land; and the hope and joyful optimism fostered by God&#39;s everlasting faithfulness. To support his understanding of the book&#39;s central theme, Woudstra repeatedly emphasizes the nature of the Hebrew narrative. It is both proleptic, offering provisional summaries of events to be taken up later in considerable detail, and programmatic, indicating that the book was written close to actual events. Also essential to Woudstra&#39;s approach is his understanding of biblical historiography. Recognizing that Old Testament studies today are in a state of flux as never before, the author takes into account the various views represented by recent scholarship as well as Hebrew usage and text-critical concerns. The commentary is supplemented by an extensive bibliography and six maps depicting topographical features, tribal territories, and significant campaigns.</p><p></p><h2>About Crustaceans: A Guide for Children</h2><p>This beginner&#x2019;s guide offers a first glimpse into the natural world of crustaceans.<br>In this addition to the acclaimed About... series educator and author Cathryn Sill uses simple, easy-to-understand language to teach children what crustaceans are, how they look, how they protect themselves, what they eat, and where they live.

He hates and is hated. His family and friends are mean and tough and they&#39;re sure he&#39;s going to end up in big trouble. But Billy knows two things about his own world. He&#39;ll never work down the mines and he does know about animals. His only companion is his kestrel hawk, trained from the nest, and, like himself, trained but not tamed, with the will to destroy or to be destroyed. This in not just another book about growing up in the north - it&#39;s as real as a slap in the face to those who think that orange juice and comprehensive schools have taken the meanness out of life in the raw working towns.</p><p>Barry Hines was born in the mining village of Hoyland Common, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Educated at Eccelsfield Grammar School, Hines then worked as an apprentice mining surveyor and played football for Barnsley before studying Physical Education at Loughborough Training College. He taught for several years in London and Yorkshire before becoming a full-time writer. Hines has written 8 other novels and television scripts.</p><h2>A Clergyman&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>Dorothy, the heroine of this novel, performs good works, cultivates good thoughts, and pricks her arm with a pin when a bad thought arises. She then has a series of unexpected and degrading adventures after becoming a victim of amnesia. Though she regains her life as a clergyman&#x2019;s daughter, she has lost her faith.<br></p><p>At the distance of a half-century, this satiric social fiction is both a treasure and a disappointment. Orwell's wit is priceless--and ruthless--as he describes rural Church of England parish life; the transitory culture of the hops harvest; a brothel's soiled linen; not to mention when his heroine hobnobs with the Trafalgar Square homeless of a bitter winter's night or bullies bored students in a fourth-rate private school: "Last term the girls had behaved badly, because she had started by treating them as human beings, and later on, when the lessons that interested them were discontinued, they had rebelled like human beings. But if you are obliged to teach children rubbish, you must not treat them as human beings.... Before all else, you must teach them it is more painful to rebel than to obey." <p> Orwell's compassion for Dorothy Hare, ensnared by faith, birth, and gender to toil thanklessly as her minister father's unpaid curate, is admirable, and his evocation, early in the novel, of a woman's consciousness totally subsumed by the mostly trivial demands of others stands shoulder to shoulder with the best feminist fiction. The dialogues between Dorothy and her dissolute middle-aged suitor, Mr. Warburton, concerning human nature, faith, and morality, are smart and fun to read. The problem (and here Orwell commits the sort of sin he denounces in Dickens) is that the novel's plot--Dorothy's picaresque amnesiac travels through the seamy side of English life--feels manufactured for the author's satiric purposes. Orwell never relinquishes his cleverness, or his maleness, to become his heroine, with the result that the reader never surrenders wholly to the fiction. Thus <i>A Clergyman's Daughter</i>, while a pleasure to pick up, is not quite a book one can't put down. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Laughter in the Dark</h2><p><p><strong>The classic novel from the author of <em>Lolita</em>, brilliantly portraying one man's ruin through love and betrayal.</strong></p><em>"Once upon a time there lived in Berlin, Germany, a man called Albinus. He was rich, respectable, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved; was not loved; and his life ended in disaster."</em> Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov's <em>Laughter in the Dark</em>; this, the author tells us, is the whole story&#x2015;except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterpiece as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others.<br><br> Published first in Russian as <em>Kamera Obskura</em> in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov's own English translation six years later. This New Directions edition, based on the text as Nabokov revised it in 1960, features a new introduction by Booker Prize-winner John Banville.</p><p>Albinus, a respectable, middle-aged man and aspiring filmmaker, abandons his wife for a lover half his age: Margot, who wants to become a movie star herself. When Albinus introduces her to Rex, an American movie producer, disaster ensues. What emerges is an elegantly sardonic and irresistibly ironic novel of desire, deceit, and deception, a curious romance set in the film world of Berlin in the 1930s.&#34;Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written that is, a ecstatically.&#34; -- John Updike</p><h2>Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariable Methods</h2><p>This bestseller will help you learn regression-analysis methods that you can apply to real-life problems.

It is not advisable, nor was it ever, to lead a Dada life."<i>&#x2015;The Posthuman Dada Guide</i></p><p><i>The Posthuman Dada Guide</i> is an impractical handbook for practical living in our posthuman world&#x2015;all by way of examining the imagined 1916 chess game between Tristan Tzara, the daddy of Dada, and V. I. Lenin, the daddy of communism. This epic game at Zurich's Caf� de la Terrasse&#x2015;a battle between radical visions of art and ideological revolution&#x2015;lasted for a century and may still be going on, although communism appears dead and Dada stronger than ever. As the poet faces the future mass murderer over the chessboard, neither realizes that they are playing for the world. Taking the match as metaphor for two poles of twentieth- and twenty-first-century thought, politics, and life, Andrei Codrescu has created his own brilliantly Dadaesque guide to Dada&#x2015;and to what it can teach us about surviving our ultraconnected present and future. Here dadaists Duchamp, Ball, and von Freytag-Loringhoven and communists Trotsky, Radek, and Zinoviev appear live in company with later incarnations, including William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Gilles Deleuze, and Newt Gingrich. <i>The Posthuman Dada Guide</i> is arranged alphabetically for quick reference and (some) nostalgia for order, with entries such as "eros (women)," "internet(s)," and "war." Throughout, it is written in the belief "that posthumans lining the road to the future (which looks as if it exists, after all, even though Dada is against it) need the solace offered by the primal raw energy of Dada and its inhuman sources.</p></p><p><p>"This highly original, beautifully written, and charming book is vintage Andrei Codrescu. No one else has written anything remotely like it. One is carried along by the author's sheer energy and drive, his good humor, his ability to laugh at himself, and his own truly Dada personality. <i>The Posthuman Dada Guide</i> will introduce Dada thinking to a whole new readership."<b>--Marjorie Perloff, author of <i>The Vienna Paradox</i></b></p><p>"No other book has treated the relationship between the artistic and revolutionary avant-gardes as originally and provocatively as Codrescu's. This is both an immensely illuminating essay of intellectual history and a disturbing meditation on absolute ideals turned into alibis for tyranny. Magically blending sarcasm and gravity, Codrescu invites us to engage in an emancipatory laughter as an antidote to morose scholasticism and dogmatic obscurantism."<b>--Vladimir Tismaneanu, author of <i>Stalinism for All Seasons</i></b></p><b>Andrei Codrescu</b> is an award-winning writer and National Public Radio commentator.

Read for pleasure by millions of Jews and Christians, consulted by students, scholars, and ordinary folk, <i>The Legends of the Jews</i> has itself become legendary, the magnum opus of one of the twentieth century's greatest and most original Jewish scholars."&#x2015;James R. Kugel, from the Introduction</p><p>The first books of the Bible describe powerfully but briefly the creation, the first generations of humanity, and the early history of the Jews. In addition to their power to inspire thought and worship, they inspired imagination. Much of the richness of Jewish belief and wisdom comes from the many legends that answered questions raised by the silences of the Bible. From the second to the fourteenth centuries, the Talmud, Midrash, and their Targums incorporated apocryphal views of Biblical persons and events to help explain scripture. Other legends found their way into the Kabbalah, into Biblical commentaries, and into Christian literature.</p><p>Never before available in paperback, Louis Ginzberg's landmark, seven-volume <i>The Legends of the Jews</i> assembles the many elaborations and embellishments of Biblical stories that flourished in the centuries following the Bible's own creation. From a portrait of Adam and Eve as innocent cannibals to tales of Moses ascending the throne of Ethiopia and visiting both hell and paradise, these legends offer strange, delightful, and occasionally bizarre variations of familiar Biblical stories. Other tales describe Eden and the building of the Tower of Babel, explain how the first Sabbath was celebrated, and chronicle the punishment of the rebel angels. There are legends that detail how Noah cared for the animals on the ark and tell of David purchasing Jerusalem rather than conquering the city.</p><p>Ginzberg devoted most of his life to gathering these Jewish legends from their original sources&#x2015;written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Syrian, Aramaic, Ethiopic, Arabic, Persian, and Old Slavic&#x2015;and reproducing them completely, accurately, and vividly. He presents these legends following the traditional Biblical sequence and reconciling the sometimes contradictory versions of the same stories found in different sources. In addition to four volumes of the legends themselves, <i>The Legends of the Jews</i> includes two indispensable volumes of notes that provide the sources for every legend and attest to the immense depth and range of Ginzberg's research, as well as a comprehensive index to the people, places, and motifs found in the legends and their sources. Nearly one hundred years after Ginzberg began, his work remains a fundamental tool of contemporary research and a classic of Jewish literature.</p></p><p>The masterpiece of one of the preeminent Talmudic scholars of the 20th century, the multivolume Legends of the Jews gathers together stories from the Talmud, the Midrash, the Bible, and oral traditions--also known as the Haggada--and offers them in chronological order. <p> Volume I, first published in 1909, features tales of The Creation of the World, The Birth of Cain and Noah, The Birth of Abraham, and The Birth of Esau and Jacob-The Favorite of Abraham. </p><p> A work of brilliant erudition and deep devotion, this is an invaluable collection of religious lore.</p><p><b>Louis Ginzberg </b> was born in Kovno (now Kaunas), Lithuania, in 1873. He began his university studies in mathematics but eventually turned to the study of religion.

Based in Italy and led by Ettore Sottsass, it overturned and re-shaped the pre-suppositions on which the production of so-called Modern Design is based. It became the almost mythical symbol of the New Design. Laughing out loud at our culture and at itself, Memphis pulled out all stops when it came to colour, pattern, decoration and ornamentation. Written by a founder-member of the group, author of &#34;Ettore Sottsass: A Critical Biography&#34;, this document is about the group and its designs. It sets out to contribute to the continuing dialogue on pop culture, the avant-garde and design.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Paradise Lost and Other Poems (Signet Classics)</h2><p>Presents three major works by the seventeenth-century English poet, including his epic poem Paradise Lost, which depicts the creation, fall, and redemption of humankind and the moral and spiritual dilemmas of God&#39;s judgment.

The Seventh Edition thoroughly analyzes 15 leading systems of psychotherapy and briefly surveys another 30, thus providing a broader scope than is available in most textbooks. Prochaska and Norcross explore each system&#39;s theory of personality, theory of psychopathology, and resulting therapeutic process and relationship. By doing so, they demonstrate how much psychotherapy systems agree on the processes producing change, while showing how they disagree on the content that needs to be changed. To bring these similarities and differences to life, the authors also present the limitations, practicalities, and outcome research of each system of psychotherapy.</p><p>James O. Prochaska, PhD, is professor of psychology and director of the Cancer Prevention Research Consortium at the University of Rhode Island and a clinical psychologist in part-time private practice. He has been the principal investigator on grants from the National Institutes of Health totaling over $75 million and has been recognized by the American Psychological Society as one of the five most-cited authors in psychology. His 30 book chapters and over 200 scholarly articles focus on self-change, health promotion, and psychotherapy from a transtheoretical perspective, the subject of his popular book, CHANGING FOR GOOD (with John Norcross and Carlo DiClemente).<br><br>John C. Norcross, PhD, is professor and former chair of psychology as well as distinguished university fellow at the University of Scranton, and a clinical psychologist in part-time independent practice.

Among his awards are APA's Distinguished Contributions to Education and Training Award, Pennsylvania Professor of the Year from the Carnegie Foundation, and election to the National Academies of Practice."SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY covers, in a scholarly and balanced manner, a wide range of theories and methods--which is what we sorely need. When using this book in one of my graduate courses, the students gave me an A+ for assigning this wide ranging and stimulating book."<br><br>"One of the great strengths of this book is the authors' obvious clinical insight and the disclosing style of writing. The colorful and honest criticisms at the end of the chapter are a compelling contribution."<br><br>"SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY provides state of the art information about counseling/therapy theories in a highly engaging manner. It is not just a superb text; it is the standard to which other texts should aspire. I recommend it most highly!"<br><br>"SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY is a special book that has a special place among theory books in psychotherapy. Most such books are duly informative, but the Prochaska and Norcross text is in a league of its own in terms of its ability to both inform and engage the reader in the material. It has everything that I look for in such a book: Depth of analysis, extremely clear and crisp writing, sound organization, and evenhandedness in its comparative review of the various theories. Bravo to Prochaska and Norcross for this wonderful accomplishment."<br><br>"In the confusing multiplicity of psychotherapeutic orientations, there is nothing better, more revealing, or more entertaining than letting orientations point out their differences with each other. That is the strategy that Prochaska and Norcross perfect in their SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY. And that is why I use their book in my psychotherapy courses with psychiatrists and psychologists throughout Europe and why their book was translated there."</p><h2>Ellsworth Kelly: Red Green Blue--Paintings and Studies, 1958-1965</h2><p><i>Red Green Blue</i> is almost the title of a 1963 painting by Ellsworth Kelly. <i>Red Blue Green</i>, a monumental rectangular oil work, considered a crucial fulcrum point in the artist's career, represents Kelly's concerns about the tension between the figure and the ground, offering two precisely shaped and balanced red and blue forms set against a strongly contrasting green ground. Working within a strict set of limits, he created a string of similarly grand, powerful works and defined many of the ideas about line, form, and color that still drive his work today. These works, made from the late 50s to the mid-60s, established the artist's singular style and his reputation as one of the most innovative abstract painters of the latter half of the 20th century, one who boldly broke with the strictures of the abstract expressionist movement, which dominated painting in the United States in the 50s. Exploring the complex interplay of invented and real-world inspirations that led to this body of figure/ground paintings, this volume presents a selection of 21 major paintings and 36 related drawings, collages, and photographs from that time period, as well as a new painting from 2002 that reexamines related concerns.</p><p><b>Ellsworth Kelly</b> was born in Newburgh, New York in 1923. His first one-person exhibition was held in 1951 in Paris, where he was studying on the G.I. Bill following World War II. Kelly returned to the United States in 1954, renting a studio in downtown New York, and his position among America's most esteemed painters began to take form. Since that time, the artist's work has been the subject of numerous major retrospectives worldwide and is presently included in all of the most important public collections of contemporary art. The drawings reproduced in this volume were on view at Matthew Marks Gallery in November, 2006, accompanying a major exhibition of new paintings and sculpture. Kelly currently lives and works in upstate New York.</p><h2>Farm Management</h2><p>This text is developed for the first course in Farm Management, typically taken by a junior/senior level student.

Nikhil Pal Singh asks what happened to the worldly and radical visions of equality that animated black intellectual activists from W. E. B. Du Bois in the 1930s to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s. In so doing, he constructs an alternative history of civil rights in the twentieth century, a long civil rights era, in which radical hopes and global dreams are recognized as central to the history of black struggle.</p><p>It is through the words and thought of key black intellectuals, like Du Bois, Ralph Bunche, C. L. R. James, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, and others, as well as movement activists like Malcolm X and Black Panthers, that vital new ideas emerged and circulated. Their most important achievement was to create and sustain a vibrant, black public sphere broadly critical of U.S. social, political, and civic inequality. </p><p>Finding racism hidden within the universalizing tones of reform-minded liberalism at home and global democratic imperatives abroad, race radicals alienated many who saw them as dangerous and separatist. Few wanted to hear their message then, or even now, and yet, as Singh argues, their passionate skepticism about the limits of U.S. democracy remains as indispensable to a meaningful reconstruction of racial equality and universal political ideals today as it ever was.</p></p><p>Nikhil Pal Singh is Visiting Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History Director of the Program in American Studies at New York University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/SINBLA_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Introduction to Chemistry 3rd Ed.</h2><p><i>Introduction to Chemistry,</i> 3e by Bauer/Birk/Marks offers today's student a fresh perspective to the introduction of chemistry.

A masterpiece&#x2019;.</p><p>One day, while browsing in a London bookshop, Elizabeth Smart chanced upon a slim volume of poetry by George Barker &#x2013; and fell passionately in love with him through the printed word. Eventually they communicated directly and, as a result of Barker&#x2019;s impecunious circumstances, Elizabeth Smart flew both him and his wife from Japan, where he was teaching, to join her in the United States. Thus began one of the most extraordinary, intense and ultimately tragic love affairs of our time.

Coyote, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry, and many other cartoon favorites.<br> Beginning with black-and-white silent cartoons, Barrier offers an insightful account, taking us inside early New York studios and such Hollywood giants as Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM. Barrier excels at illuminating the creative side of animation--revealing how stories are put together, how animators develop a character, how technical innovations enhance the "realism" of cartoons. Here too are colorful portraits of the giants of the field, from Walt and Roy Disney and their animators, to Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera.<br> Based on hundreds of interviews with veteran animators, <em>Hollywood Cartoons</em> gives us the definitive inside look at this colorful era and at the creative process behind these marvelous cartoons.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Barrier</strong> is a recognized authority on film cartoons. For many years he was the publisher and editor of <em>Funnyworld</em>, the most widely respected magazine devoted to the animated film. He lives in Alexandria, Virginia.<br><br>"Why is Marjorie Belcher the world's most durable film star? Because she was the model for Walt Disney's Snow White and for the Blue Fairy in 'Pinochio'....This is one of the many odd facts to be gleaned from Michael Barrier's account of the development of Hollywood animation. Bet you didn't know, for example, that Sneezy the dwarf was originally to have been Deafy--until someone, long before the days of political correctness, spotted the unconscious slur. Or that Pluto was at first to have been called Rover....His book is rich in nuggets that bring the era, from roughly 1910 to the mid-1960's, vividly to life."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"This long awaited book by Michael Barrier, a pioneer in the field of animation studies, raises the bar for serious analysis of Hollywood animation and animators during the 'Golden Age' of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Barrier's research is rich and impeccable, his arguments articulate, and his uncompromising, astringent conclusions will be a source of scholarly debate and discussion for years to come."--John Canemaker, animator and author of <em>Before the Animation Begins</em>, <em>Tex Avery: The MGM Years</em>, <em>Felix: The Twisted Tale of the World's Most Famous Cat</em>, and professor and head of animation studies at New York University Tisch School of the Arts<p></p><br>"The highly readable result is neither weighted down with scholarly discourse nor demeaned by trivial anecdotes. <em>Hollywood Cartoons</em> might well become the standard survey in its area. All libraries should consider for purchase."--Neal Baker, <em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Barrier's book is a major contribution to our understanding of the work of not only the Disney animators, but also of men like Max and Dave Fleischer, Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, John Hubley, and the brilliant Warner Bros. crew, especially Tex Avery, Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones....The book is likely to become a standard history of American animation up to Disney's death in 1996."--<em>Palm Beach Florida News</em><p></p><br>"<em>Hollywood Cartoons</em> is the best book ever written about golden-age animation."--<em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"More than 30 years ago, Michael Barrier started interviewing animation industry veterans for his <em>Hollywood Cartoons</em>....Unlike most of us, who write about cartoons as if they were another kind of movie, Mr. Barrier describes the development of the animated art form from the guts outward. He convincingly illuminates how line drawings evolved to the point where they could convey personalities and emotions as vividly as the greatest film or stage actor."--<em>The New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"A substantial history of animated cartoons, both seven-minute shorts and feature films, <em>Hollywood Cartoons</em> gives proper weight to a subject often considered frivolous....Michael Barrier's <em>Hollywood Cartoons</em> draws from the deepest reservoir of firsthand recollections gathered from producers, directors, animators, background artists, musicians, even ink-and-paint specialists from roughly 1920 to 1966....Barrier makes palpable the rigors of an animator's task, and thereby enhances our appreciation, indeed awe, of their accomplishments."--<em>The Plain Dealer</em><p></p><br>"A very detailed account of animated cartoons, strongly emphasizing the influence and personality of Walt Disney....This genre's history is still undercovered, so cartoon expert Barrier's book should come as a welcome addition to researchers and fans....The author takes an interesting tack in contrasting Disney's self-image with views of his associates and friends."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Michael Barrier's meticulously researched yet enchantingly innocent <em>Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in its Golden Age</em> restores much of the magic to the cartoon kingdom. This definitive depiction of our most American medium will leave all but the most hardened Disnophobe shouting Yabba-Dabba-Doo!"--Jacob M. Appel, <em>The Boston Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Barrier has given the reader a comprehensive--yet finely detailed--survey of the American animated cartoon over the decades. For the film buff, or more specifically, for the cartoon enthusiast, his book will be a welome addition to the home reference shelf."--<em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Monsters: A Supernatural History of the Third Reich</h2><p><b>The definitive history of the supernatural in Nazi Germany, exploring the occult ideas, esoteric sciences, and pagan religions touted by the Third Reich in the service of power</b><br><br> The Nazi fascination with the occult is legendary, yet today it is often dismissed as Himmler&#x2019;s personal obsession or wildly overstated for its novelty. Preposterous though it was, however, supernatural thinking was inextricable from the Nazi project. The regime enlisted astrology and the paranormal, paganism, Indo-Aryan mythology, witchcraft, miracle weapons, and the lost kingdom of Atlantis in reimagining German politics and society and recasting German science and religion. In this eye-opening history, Eric Kurlander reveals how the Third Reich&#x2019;s relationship to the supernatural was far from straightforward. Even as popular occultism and superstition were intermittently rooted out, suppressed, and outlawed, the Nazis drew upon a wide variety of occult practices and esoteric sciences to gain power, shape propaganda and policy, and pursue their dreams of racial utopia and empire.</p><p><b>Eric Kurlander</b> is professor of history at Stetson University.

The teaching approach adapts widely-accepted foreign language teaching theories to the teaching of the Chinese language. This series is designed for young students taking exams such as SAT II, IGCSE, IB, HSK or for those students who are starting to learn Chinese on their own. The primary goal of the 3rd series is to help students establish a solid foundation of vocabulary, grammar, knowledge of Chinese and communication skills through natural and graduate integration of language, content and culture. The simultaneous development of listening, speaking, reading and writing is especially emphasized. The aim is to help students develop skills to communicate in Chinese in authentic contexts and express their viewpoints appropriately, precisely, logically and coherently. The unique characteristic of the 3rd edition is that the programme allows the teacher to use a combination of various effective teaching approaches, including the Communicative Approach and a task-based approach, while taking into account the Chinese language system.</p><p>Ms. Yamin Ma has an M.Ed. in Curriculum Design and Instruction from Queen&#39;s University, Canada.

In this long, reflective novel, Huysmans' alter-ego, Durtal, sets out to explore the mystic symbolism embodied in one of the greatest gothic edifices in France, Chartres cathedral. Written at the time of the Dreyfus Affair, a political scandal that threatened to tear France apart, Chartres cathedral became for Huysmans a potent symbol of the harmonious diversity of the Middle Ages, one that had the potential to unify the divisions in contemporary French society. This complex, multi-layered vision of Chartres cathedral as a structure in which art, science and religion could exist in harmony rather than discord, captured the public imagination on its first publication, and The Cathedral became a runaway bestseller.<br><br>This edition contains 20 photographs of parts of Chartres cathedral mentioned in the text.</p><p>J.K.Huysmans (1847-1907) began writing as a naturalist in the style of Zola. .He changed from being an obscure author and art critic to one of the most famous authors of his day with the publication of A Rebours (Against Nature) in 1884. His novel about Satanism, La-Bas (1891)is the cult novel of the nineteenth century.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Hands</h2><p><p>Intended for all readers--including magicians, detectives, musicians, orthopedic surgeons, and anthropologists--this book offers a thorough account of that most intriguing and most human of appendages: the hand. In this illustrated work, John Napier explores a wide range of absorbing subjects such as fingerprints, handedness, gestures, fossil remains, and the making and using of tools.</p></p><p>The late <i>John Napier</i> was a physician specializing in hands, and was also a professor and writer on primates and evolution. <i>Russell H. Tuttle</i> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago."Maybe Newton was right about the thumb [that it was evidence of God's existence], but there is far more to arouse wonder in the hand than he knew, and Dr. Napier indicates its scope with authority and imagination." (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"[John Napier's] book is deliberately 'not too technical,' light and full of wit. . . . Fingerprints, gestures, nerves, bone, hand hair--all are given attention . . . in this interesting survey."

She has discovered that her husband is having an affair with Thelma Rice.</p><p>Is it possible to write a sidesplitting novel about the breakup of the perfect marriage? If the writer is Nora Ephron, the answer is a resounding yes. For in this inspired confection of adultery, revenge, group therapy, and pot roast, the creator of Sleepless in Seattle reminds us that comedy depends on anguish as surely as a proper gravy depends on flour and butter. Seven months into her pregnancy, Rachel Samstat discovers that her husband, Mark, is in love with another woman. The fact that the other woman has &#34;a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs&#34; is no consolation. Food sometimes is, though, since Rachel writes cookbooks for a living. And in between trying to win Mark back and loudly wishing him dead, Ephron&#39;s irrepressible heroine offers some of her favorite recipes. Heartburn is sinfully delicious novel, as soul-satisfying as mashed potatoes and as airy as a perfect souffle.Nora Ephron (1941-2012) received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay for When Harry Met Sally, Silkwood, and Sleepless in Seattle, which she also directed. She lived in New York City and was married to the writer Nicholas Pileggi</p><h2>ISIS: A History</h2><p><p>The Islamic State has stunned the world with its savagery, destructiveness, and military and recruiting successes. What explains the rise of ISIS, and what does it portend for the future of the Middle East? In this book, one of the world's leading authorities on political Islam and jihadism sheds new light on these questions. Moving beyond journalistic accounts, Fawaz Gerges provides a clear and compelling explanation of the deeper conditions that fuel ISIS. This unique history shows how decades of dictatorship, poverty, and rising sectarianism in the Middle East, exacerbated by foreign intervention, led to the rise and growth of ISIS&#x2015;and why addressing those problems is the only way to ensure its end. An authoritative introduction to arguably the most important conflict in the world today, this is an essential book for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the social turmoil and political violence ravaging the Arab-Islamic world.</p></p><p><p>"Not just timely but unlikely ever to be bettered, this is an indispensable guide to the evolution of the Arab world's leading terrorist organization by a global expert. Fawaz Gerges's book is judicious, well argued, and based on a close personal acquaintance with conditions in Iraq and Syria. It is unrivaled in its ability to unravel the ideological and political power struggles among ISIS leaders. And it is an often shocking indictment of Western missteps in dealing with the organization's growing capacity to harm foreign interests."<b>--Roger Owen, author of <i>The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life</i></b></p><p>"Fawaz Gerges, long one of the most perceptive writers about the Middle East, has written a lucid and erudite account of the rise of ISIS that will be read with great profit by both specialists and the general public."<b>--Peter Bergen, author of <i>United States of Jihad</i>, <i>Manhunt</i>, and <i>The Longest War</i></b></p><p>"In the flood of recent publications about ISIS, Gerges provides a welcome island of thoroughly researched analysis by a major authority on extremist Muslim movements. Both general readers and specialists will benefit from Gerges's balanced and well-informed understanding of this important and dangerous movement."<b>--John Voll, professor emeritus, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"In this original and empirically rich study, Fawaz Gerges persuasively analyzes the rise and power of ISIS. Building on his profound knowledge of salafi and jihadi movements, he locates ISIS squarely in its context, dissecting the ideas and political factors that have made it so surprisingly formidable in Iraq and Syria, as well as disturbingly influential elsewhere."<b>--Charles Tripp, SOAS, University of London</b></p><p>"Fawaz Gerges is the right scholar to bring the history of ISIS past its journalistic first draft. This should be a valuable source for policymakers, specialists, and the public alike."<b>--Noah Feldman, Harvard Law School</b></p><p>"This is quite simply the definitive book on the group by a very smart, well-informed guide to the region, superbly researched, well-written and intelligent throughout. Everyone opining about ISIS should be required to read this book first."<b>--Fareed Zakaria</b></p><p>"Fawaz Gerges is a first-class expert on contemporary Jihadist movements. This book should have a wide readership."<b>--Ian Lustick, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><b>Fawaz A.

An 1825 commission from patron John Linnell enabled him to focus on illustrating Dante's tales &#x2014; the type of visionary work to which his talents were ideally suited. The artist spent the last three years of his life creating these images, which range from completely finished pieces to rough sketches. Blake's highly original approach offers not only an excellent introduction to Dante's allegorical tales, but also a new and fresh perspective for those already familiar with the<i> Divine Comedy</i>.</p><p>Painter, printer, and poet, William Blake (1757-1827) was a master at expressing great literature through his art. Perhaps the finest engraver in English history, Blake's illuminated books &#x2014; filled with sketches and watercolors that boggle the mind with their beauty and detail &#x2014; are as sought after today as they were over a hundred years ago.</p><h2>The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America</h2><p>Protest is everywhere in American politics. Over the past decade, activists have staged dramatic demonstrations on such diverse issues as the war in Iraq, globalization, standardized testing, and abortion rights. Indeed, protest and social movements have become essential features of contemporary American life. <em>The Politics of Protest</em> offers both a historical overview and an analytical framework for understanding social movements and political protest in American politics. The book suggests that protest movements, clearly an integral part of our nation's history from the Boston Tea Party to the Civil Rights Movement, are hardly confined to the distant past. It argues that protest movements in America reflect and influence mainstream politics. In order to understand our political system-and our social and political world-we need to pay attention to protest. <br><br><em>The Politics of Protest</em> opens with a short history of social movements in the United States, beginning with the development of the American Republic and outlining how the American constitutional design invites protest movements to offer continual challenges. It then discusses the social impulse to protest, considers the strategies and tactics of social movements, looks at the institutional response to protest, and finally examines the policy ramifications. Each chapter includes a brief narrative of a key movement that illustrates the topic covered in that chapter. Drawing students in and clearly demonstrating how and why the subject is of importance to them, the book addresses such topics as Dorothy Day's Catholic Workers' protest against nuclear fallout drills in the 1950s, the Greensboro civil rights sit-in in 1960, and the so-called "Battle in Seattle" anti-globalization rally. Providing a concise, yet lively analysis of social movements in America, <em>The Politics of Protest</em> is ideal for political science or sociology courses that consider social movements and political protest.</p><p>David S.

In a departure from the more refined tea ceremony utensils that represent the meditative aspect of the ceremony, Oribe ware has a more earthy feel, with its layering of naturally occurring colors: a piece might be made of red and white clay, with green glaze over the white portion, and line decorations done in iron over a coat of white slip on the red part. This ware is named for Furuta Oribe, who in his time was the undisputed master of the tea ceremony and who, it is said, commissioned certain kilns to make these pots after his own designs. <br><br>Likewise, the tea ceremony ware known as Shino is widely considered to have its own unparalleled kind of beauty. With its thick, white, feldspathic glaze and stylized but seemingly spontaneous decoration in iron underglaze, it has an unmistakable sense of softness and naturalness. <br><br>Both Shino and Oribe are still being made today, but in many cases it is the older examples that are most striking. Classic Stoneware of Japan brings together these early great pieces with important newer work, in 150 color photographs, and outlines each ware in informative essays - written by two noted authorities - on each tradition's history and techniques. <br><br><em>Classic Stoneware of Japan</em> offers a comprehensive visual survey and a basic understanding of these traditions' glazes, processes, shapes and decoration. The reader comes away with a clear idea of the essence of these wares and an ability to instantly recognize either. It will be invaluable for anyone interested in pottery, design or art. <br><br><em>Classic Stoneware of Japan</em> is the combined edition of two earlier volumes, Shino and Oribe, originally published independently in the series <em>Famous Ceramics of Japan</em>. This new, combined edition is a fascinating guide to these enduring and vital art forms.</p><p>[From the book; the first pages of the Plate Notes] <p>Shino </p><p>1. Picture Shino water container, name: Kogan ("Weathered Shore"). H. 18.0 cm. Important Cultural Object. Hatakeyama Collection. </p><p>There are not many Old Shino water containers to be found in Japan. The most famous of this elite group is the piece known as Kogan. It was probably fired at the Ogaya Kamashita kiln at the beginning of the seventeenth century. </p><p>Its bottom edge (tatamitsuki) is extremely powerful. The lip has been notched, and the neck squeezed in with mathematical, almost frightening, precision. One might mistakenly assume that Furuta Oribe had a hand in this piece, as it is very much in the style he espoused. There is nothing incomplete about it. </p><p>The continuous design on the pot is not itself unusual, but here the execution is grand. It is hard to believe that it was done by a potter. Kitaoji Rosanjin has said that it is not necessary to stare long and hard at the pictures drawn by Momoyama potters. This jar is a wonderful example of that principle. </p><p>The color of the feldspathic Shino glaze is especially fine. The design -- it is difficult to tell whether it is of reeds or pampas grass -- is lively. </p><p>It seems to have been thrown rather casually, omitting fine details. It owes much of its effect to the events that occurred during firing: ishihaze ("stone bursting" -- pits caused by the melting of feldspar granules in the clay) and cracks by the heat. </p><p>It is not known who named the pot Kogan, but one can imagine that the lonely name was inspired by a cold, late autumn wind blowing off the mountains. </p><p>2, 3. Picture Shino teabowl, name: U no Hanagaki ("Fence of Deutzia Flowers"). D. 11.8 cm. National Treasure. </p><p>This bowl is said to have originally been in the possession of the Fuyuki family, apparently one of Tokyo's most prosperous houses in the Edo period. From Tokyo, the bowl came into the hands of the Yamada Hachirobei family of Osaka. Subsequently, according to the Taisho meikikan, it was sold at a Kyoto auction in 1890 for the sum of 1,000 yen in gold. Now it belongs to the Mitsui family. </p><p>Given the fact that there are virtually no other teabowls in Japan that have been designated National Treasures, it seems safe to say that this is the finest teabowl in existence. </p><p>The inscription on the box lid is attributed to the tea master Katagiri Sekishu. On the inside of the lid a poem card has been affixed with a poem that reads: </p><p>The inner essence<br> Of the fence of deutzia flowers<br> In a mountain village:<br> The feeling of treading a road<br> Covered with freshly fallen snow. </p><p>It is not certain who wrote this poem, but the style of calligraphy is one at which Sekishu excelled, so some think that this poem is his as well. </p><p>The bowl was fired at the Ogaya Mutabora kiln. Its irregular shape is indescribably elegant. The glazing, too, is superb. The red at the lip, caused by the fire in the kiln, and the flowing design, are especially beautiful. </p><p>There is another teabowl, called U no Hana ("Deutzia Flowers"), done in the same style. The late Fujio Koyama reported in a journal article that a third companion piece, a bowl with pine tree design, turned up in Kanazawa. </p><p>It has been established that Kato Genjuro Kagenari was the founder of the kilns at Ogaya. And while the claim made by some that this bowl is one of his works may well be true, it seems strange that this should be the only known example of his pottery. A brown-glazed tea caddy attributed to him has been passed down through generations of the Konoe family, but only the Konoe family regards this as authentic. Genjuro may in fact have made this tea caddy and the U no Hanagaki teabowl, but these attributions are traditional and cannot be proven. </p><p>4, 5. White tenmoku tea bowl. D. 12.3 cm. Important Cultural Object. Tokugawa Reimeikai Foundation. </p><p>This is a dignified white tenmoku teabowl lined with gold at the rim. (The tenmoku term comes from the utensils used at a Buddhist temple on Mt. Tenmoku -- Tianmu in Chinese -- in China's Zhejiang Province.) </p><p>Judging from the way the foot was trimmed, the bowl is thought to have been made sometime in the Tensho era (1573-92), which means that it is one of the earliest examples of Shino's feldspathic glaze. </p><p>There are only two such bowls known to exist. One has been passed down through the Maeda family of Kaga. The bowl shown here has come down through the Owari branch of the Tokugawa family. </p><p>I saw this bowl well over ten years ago, but the memory of it is still with me. It is well rounded, not at all severe like Chinese tenmoku. It is soft, luscious, truly representative of Japanese tenmoku. </p><p>There is no question that Shino ware was made at Mino during the Momoyama and early Edo periods. There is a school of thought that holds that Shino's antecedents are in the Muromachi period, and its adherents maintain that this bowl was made in Owari at that time. But the more common view is, as stated earlier, that this bowl was made in the Tensho era, probably at Ohira. The so-called Chrysanthemum Tenmoku made at Seto (Owari) adheres strictly to the style of its Chinese predecessors made at the kilns of Jian. The walls of this piece, however, have been pulled up toward the top of the body to make it more bowlike. And the trimming of the foot is different from that seen in Chrysanthemum Tenmoku. </p><p>It is not known when the practice of offering a bowl of tea to the Buddha image in temples began, but we do know that in the Muromachi period bowls began to be made in Japan for that purpose to supplement bowls imported from China. I have one such Japanese bowl in my collection, though it is a black-glazed piece rather than Shino ware. Also, a yellow-glazed bowl unearthed at Akatsu and thought to be from the Northern and Southern Courts period (1336-92) shows a trimmed foot similar to the one on this White Tenmoku piece. </p><p>6. Gray Shino, "picture frame" shallow dish, design of grasses and flowers. W. 23.7 cm. Umezawa Memorial Gallery. </p><p>There are perhaps ten shallow dishes in existence with "picture frame" shapes, but this piece is unique in terms of its decoration and its glaze application. The scenery deep in the mountains of Mino is depicted. The design and coloring combine to full and graceful effect. </p><p>Shallow dishes like this were produced at Ohira, Ogaya, and Kujiri. Each one has its own personality. </p><p>7. Gray Shino sewing dish, design of grasses. W. 16.0 cm. Hakone Museum of Art. </p><p>Since all Momoyama period serving dishes made for use in the meal accompanying a formal tea ceremony are large, today they are often used as bowls. </p><p>This piece was originally one of a set of five, but the rest have since been sold to different owners. It is of the finest workmanship, and its gray is a perfect example of the flames of the kiln at work. </p><p>As a serving dish, it is a fine piece, but as a piece of artistic pottery, it is even more noteworthy. </p><p>8. Picture Shino bowl, design of flowering plum branches. W. 26.9 cm. Hakone Museum of Art. </p><p>Tenko the god of the kiln, clearly had a hand in this piece. Among works of similar type, this bowl is preeminent. Its color is particularly clean, and it is considered the best example of a Shino serving bowl. Though some feel it is from Ogaya, more likely it is a product of the Kujiri Motoyashiki kiln at its peak at the beginning of the seventeenth century. </p><p>9. Plain Shino sake bottle; Shino Oribe sake bottle. Left: H. 17.5 cm. Right: H. 18.0 cm. </p><p>These were excavated in the vicinity of the Otomi kiln. No such bottles have been handed down; all are excavated pieces. They seem to have been used as everyday ware rather than as tea ceremony pieces. Both have been repaired at the neck, but this does not detract from their appearance. </p><p>Shino sake bottles are rare. The design on the right-hand bottle is rhythmical and has a forceful beauty.</p><br>RYOJI KURODA (1905-87) was for many years the chairman of the Japan Ceramic Society, and is also the author of numerous books on ceramics, including <em>Kokon no meito</em> ("Famous Ceramics, Ancient and Modern") and a definitive biography of the potter Rosanjin. <br><br>TAKESHI MURAYAMA (b. 1934) worked first as editor of Tosetsu, the magazine of the Tokyo Ceramic Society, and later as the managing director of the society itself.

Just four years later,&nbsp;that same government collapsed, and Congress&nbsp;grudgingly&nbsp;agreed to support&nbsp;the 1787 Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, which altered the Articles beyond recognition.&nbsp;What occurred during this remarkably brief interval to cause the Confederation to lose public confidence and inspire Americans to replace&nbsp;it with&nbsp;a&nbsp;dramatically more&nbsp;flexible and&nbsp;powerful government? <i>We Have Not a Government</i> is the story of this contentious moment in American history.<br><br> In George William Van Cleve&#x2019;s book, we encounter a sharply divided America.&nbsp;The Confederation faced massive war debts with virtually no authority to compel its members to pay them. It experienced punishing trade restrictions and strong resistance to American territorial expansion from powerful European governments. Bitter sectional divisions that deadlocked the Continental Congress arose from exploding western settlement. And a deep, long-lasting recession led to sharp controversies and social unrest across the country amid roiling debates over greatly increased taxes, debt relief, and paper money. Van Cleve shows how these remarkable stresses transformed the Confederation into a stalemate government and eventually led previously conflicting states, sections, and interest groups to advocate for a union powerful enough to govern a continental empire.<br><br> Touching on the stories of a wide-ranging cast of characters&#x2014;including John Adams, Patrick Henry, Daniel Shays, George Washington, and Thayendanegea&#x2014;Van Cleve makes clear that it was the Confederation&#x2019;s failures that created a political crisis and led to the 1787 Constitution. Clearly argued and superbly written, <i>We Have Not a Government</i> is a must-read history of this crucial period in our nation&#x2019;s early life.</p><p><b>George William Van Cleve</b> is research professor in law and history at Seattle University School of Law.

He draws sharp conclusions and generally takes decided stands on matters that historians still actively dispute. . . .What Van Cleve does demonstrate, persuasively, is that the genuine crisis of the Confederation required creating a &#x201c;staggeringly powerful&#x201d; national government through a &#x201c;grand bargain&#x201d; that went well beyond what any state might have asked for itself.&#x201d; (Jack Rakove, Pulitzer Prize winner <i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>"With careful attention and rich research, this book examines in depth each of the ways that the Confederation failed."

Each house is meticulously illustrated and accompanied by complete floor plans.<br>"A poorly planned house is usually more expensive than a modern practical plan," according to the author, architect Herbert C. Chivers. Combining "modern methods" with attractive but modestly priced plans, Chivers promoted his business with sketches of stylish homes, accompanied by brief captions stating dimensions, prices, and occasional suggestions for modifications. This reprint of his complete guide to domestic architecture of the early 1900s constitutes a valuable resource for home hobbyists, architecture students and professionals, as well as antique collectors.</p><p></p><h2>Edvard Munch: Behind the Scream</h2><p><p><b>The biography of the artist who created the most haunting icon of the twentieth century</b><br><br> Although almost everyone recognizes Edvard Munch&#x2019;s famous painting <i>The Scream, </i>hardly anyone knows much about the man. What kind of person could have created this universal image, one that so vividly expressed all the uncertainties of the twentieth century? What kind of experiences did he have? In this book, the first comprehensive biography of Edvard Munch in English, Sue Prideaux brings the artist fully to life. Combining a scholar&#x2019;s precision with a novelist&#x2019;s insight, she explores the events of his turbulent life and unerringly places his experiences in their intellectual, emotional, and spiritual contexts. With unlimited access to tens of thousands of Munch&#x2019;s papers, including his letters and diaries, Prideaux offers a portrait of the artist that is both intimate and moving. Munch sought to paint what he experienced rather than what he saw, and as his life often veered out of control, his experiences were painful. Yet he painted throughout his long life, creating strange and dramatic works in which hysteria and violence lie barely concealed beneath the surface. An extraordinary genius, Munch connects with an audience that reaches around the world and across more than a century.</p></p><p><p><b>Sue Prideaux </b>is an art historian and the author of four novels.</p>*Starred Review* Edvard Munch (1863-1944) has always generated controversy. Long after his best-known work, <i>The Scream</i>, attained iconic status as a <i>Mona Lisa</i> of modern angst, it was brazenly stolen from Norway's National Museum as though Munch exerted what art historian Prideaux described as his "psychotic inability to part with his paintings" from the grave. Not to mention taking a final swipe at a society that vilified him. As one reads Prideaux's meticulously detailed yet always companionable and often startling account of Munch's dramatically difficult life and extraordinarily intense psyche, one marvels that he lived so long and achieved so much. Buffeted by his father's hellfire religious beliefs, his mother's and sister's early deaths, and his own grave illnesses, Munch turned to drawing and writing as modes of survival, and so extensive are his compelling journals, Prideaux makes Munch's voice a key aspect of her narrative. Prone to visions and indifferent to convention, Munch drank to excess, went hungry, became enmeshed in harrowing romantic entanglements, and suffered vicious condemnation of his shocking work. As Prideaux vividly chronicles Munch's tumultuous life in turbulent times in Norway, Paris, and Berlin, the reader's appreciation of this bold spirit who risked all to descend into the realm of archetypes and create art depicting "the secret life of the soul" grows exponentially. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It approaches the history of psychology from a scientific perspective. <b> </b> Chapter topics include: the psychology of consciousness, the unconscious mind, and adaptation; the conspiracy of naturalism; the golden age and decline of behaviorism; the rise of cognitive science; the birth of applied psychology; the rise of professional psychology; and the psychological society. <b> </b> For individuals interested in the history of psychology&#x2014;and what it is today. </p></p><p>PREFACE <p> There has not been an edition of A History of Modern Psychology since 1994, while there have been two new editions of A History of Psychology in the same period. I have incorporated into this third edition all the relevant changes from A History of Psychology, without reducing this book's expanded coverage of contemporary psychology. </p><p> The most obvious new features of this edition are structural. I have included a new Chapter Two that summarizes the history of psychology from the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution up to the middle of the nineteenth century. In writing these chapters, I have drawn not only from A History of Psychology but from a paper, "Mind as scientific object: An historical-philosophical exploration," written for Mind as Scientific Object (D. Johnson &amp; C. Erneling (Eds.), Oxford University Press, in press), and two articles, "The Renaissance through the Eighteenth Century," and "The Nineteenth Century through Freud," for the APA Encyclopedia of Psychology (Oxford University Press, 2000). </p><p> Chapters 3 to 7 on the founding of psychology and the conspiracy of naturalism have been updated, the most notable change being to Chapter 4, The Psychology of the Unconscious, which is now organized temporally rather than topically. The treatment of psychology in the twentieth century has been both updated and re-organized to provide a clearer focus on each of the two strands of modern psychology: scientific psychology and professional psychology. Chapters 8 to 10 tell the story of the scientific study of the mind in the twentieth century up to about 2000. Chapters 11 to 13 tell the story of professional psychology in the same years. This structural change reflects two concerns of mine. First, in my own teaching I have found that shuttling back and forth between very different narrative strands that happen to occur in the same time period confuses students. I think the pictures of both scientific and professional psychology become clearer by telling each story separately. Secondly, as a number of observers have pointed out, scientific and professional psychology are increasingly going their separate ways despite occasional protests, and my separation of the two narratives reflects what I believe is historical reality. Finally, separating the material should make it easier for teachers to emphasize one or the other topic. </p><p> As always, I would be happy to hear any comments from professors or students about A History of Modern Psychology, Third Edition.

It is a book about discovering the secret to all the things we most desire: contentment, meaning, peace of mind, and true freedom. This skillfully edited translation of selections from the writings of Meister Eckhart provides a roadmap to the spiritual life for contemporary seekers. Eckhart takes us on a journey of discovery; a journey in which we learn to let go, relinquish our need to know everything, and lose those things that we think are important for a life of worth. And in the end he shows us that the true secret is this: to find yourself, you must lose yourself.</p><p>Here is timeless wisdom from a medieval mystic who has influenced a wide range of spiritual teachers and mystics both inside and outside the Christian tradition. Erich Fromm, Arthur Schopenhauer, Dag Hammarskj�ld, Eckhart Tolle, Richard Rohr, D. T. Suzuki, Rudolf Steiner, and Matthew Fox have all credited Eckhart as being an important influence on their thought. In addition, his work has influenced the development of 20th-century American Buddhism and the Theosophical tradition.</p><p>Divided into five sections&#x2015;Seeking the Light, Facing Darkness, Risking Love, Knowing Nothing, and Embracing Everything&#x2015;the book leads readers on the path to an authentic spiritual life.</p></p><p><b>Jon M.

Burrows</b> is a poet, translator, and professor of religion and literature at the Protestant University of Applied Sciences in Bochum, Germany. His poetry has appeared in Poetry, the Cortland Review, the Southern Quarterly, Weavings, and a number of other periodicals."Poet Burrows and scholar Sweeney (<i>Meister Eckhart&#x2019;s Book of the Heart</i>) collect meditations derived from the writings of 14th-century mystical Dominican friar Meister Eckhart in this moving selection of poetic interpretations based on his quotations. The authors have translated Eckhart&#x2019;s original sermons and academic texts, both from Latin and German into English and from prose into poetry. They consider their work a &#x201c;carrying over&#x201d; of his insights for readers &#x201c;for whom the style of his writings might not be easily accessible.&#x201d; The book contains five loose sections with titles that suggest the paradoxical nature of Eckhart&#x2019;s work, including &#x201c;Knowing Nothing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Embracing Everything.&#x201d; The meditation-poems create a satisfying thematic arc if read from start to finish, or they can be selected at random as part of a meditation practice. While most of the poems feature God (and some specifically reference the Bible), the insights often speak to a broader spirituality, such as: &#x201c;So you want to learn to love God?/ Well there is no particular way,/ since God is not to be found in any/ way...&#x201d; These short poems, filled with the Dominican mystic&#x2019;s insight and levity, will make for a fine introduction to Eckhart&#x2019;s thinking. (Oct.)" --<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b>, Reviewed on 08/02/2019, <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Positioned as a follow-up to&nbsp;<i>Meister Eckhart&#x2019;s Book of the Heart: Meditations for the Restless Soul</i>, this book by collaborators Sweeney and Burrows collects meditations from the 14th-century priest and mystic Eckhart von Hochheim, better known as Meister Eckhart. Though presented as a combination of prose and poems, the work notes that Eckhart himself did not write poetry. Rather, these are curated theological reflections presented in poetic form with many lines taken verbatim from Eckhart&#x2019;s more formal theological discourses and sermons. In this, Sweeney and Burrows have crafted something akin to a road map to centering prayer. Eckhart&#x2019;s mystical musings lead toward an 'undoing, letting go of our need to manage our lives, freeing ourselves to seek this treasure.'

Above all, the burning alive of more than 280 men and women for their religious beliefs seared the rule of &#x201c;Bloody Mary&#x201d; into the protestant imagination as an alien aberration in the onward and upward march of the English-speaking peoples.</p><p>In this controversial reassessment, the renowned reformation historian Eamon Duffy argues that Mary's regime was neither inept nor backward looking. Led by the queen's cousin, Cardinal Reginald Pole, Mary&#x2019;s church dramatically reversed the religious revolution imposed under the child king Edward VI. Inspired by the values of the European Counter-Reformation, the cardinal and the queen reinstated the papacy and launched an effective propaganda campaign through pulpit and press.</p><p>Even the most notorious aspect of the regime, the burnings, proved devastatingly effective.

Yeats and Ezra Pound, the crucial winters these poets spent living together in Stone Cottage in Sussex (1913-1916) have remained a mystery. Working from a large base of previously unpublished material, James Longenbach presents for the first time the untold story of these three winters. Inside the secret world of Stone Cottage, Pound's Imagist poems were inextricably linked to Yeats's studies in spiritualism and magic, and early drafts of <em>The Cantos</em> reveal that the poem began in response to the same esoteric texts that shaped Yeats's visionary system. At the same time, Yeats's autobiographies and Noh-style plays took shape with Pound's assistance. Having retreated to Sussex to escape the flurry of wartime London, both poets tracked the progress of the Great War and in response wrote poems--some unpublished until now--that directly address the poet's political function. More than the story of a literary friendship, <em>Stone Cottage</em> explores the Pound-Yeats connection within the larger context of modern literature and culture, illuminating work that ranks with the greatest achievements of modernism.</p><p>James Longenbach is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Rochester."Longenbach engages in some fine historiography....Establish[es] him as one of his generation's closest students of poetic modernism, a critic whose patched histories we can look forward to reading with pleasure in the coming years."--Modern Language Quarterly<br><br>"An excellent study of early modernist poetry."--Vincent Quinn, Brooklyn College<br><br>"Has already revised our sense of modernist literature and will endure to prove one of the seminal texts of the history of modernism."--Paideuma<br><br>"Longenbach's account of the relation between Pound and Yeats, during and after the Stone Cottage winters, is far more detailed and intimate than any previous version....Contains much detail of interest...including several hitherto unpublished poems and fragments by Pound and by Yeats."--The<br>New York Review of Books<br><br>"Longenbach has gone back to the day-to-day records of Pound and Yeats during what were perhaps the crucial years of modernism--the years when Pound was drafting his first set of Cantos and Yeats was remaking his early style. What he's found is extraordinary: a record of spiritualist interest<br>and experimentation that will force all of us to reconsider our understanding of the Cantos and rethink the rationale of modernism. That along with the group of unpublished works Longenbach has unearthed and his picture of Pound and Yeats at work (which takes us well beyond Ellmann's Eminent<br>Domain) add up to an unusually valuable piece of work."--Ronald Bush, California Institute of Technology<br><br>"In its judiciousness, humaneness and gracefully borne learning [the book] calls to mind the late Richard Ellmann at the height of his powers. It is at once an imposing piece of research, a fundamental contribution to the study of early modernism, and a deftly told narrative that abounds in<br>pathos, irony, and outright comedy. This book will permanently and radically alter the received wisdom about Pound's relation to Yeats."--Frederick Crews, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"Literary criticism of the highest order....Longenbach means not only to revalue the roots of modernism but the way in which such evaluations should be made."--Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"A refreshingly empirical and substantive contribution....His study consolidates between hard covers, and with vastly more information, insights into the Pound-Yeats relationship that have been appearing piecemeal here and there for a decade or so."--The Kenyon Review<br><br>"Throws genuine light on the history of modernism....Provid[es] a fascinating account of the creative dialogue and collaboration between the two poets....An elegantly argued revision of modernist history."--Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"An excellent contribution to what is already known about a great literary friendship."--Choice</p><h2>Being Alive: Essays on Movement, Knowledge and Description</h2><p><p>Anthropology is a disciplined inquiry into the conditions and potentials of human life. Generations of theorists, however, have expunged life from their accounts, treating it as the mere output of patterns, codes, structures or systems variously defined as genetic or cultural, natural or social. Building on his classic work <em>The Perception of the Environment</em>, Tim Ingold sets out to restore life to where it should belong, at the heart of anthropological concern. </p> <p><em>Being Alive</em> ranges over such themes as the vitality of materials, what it means to make things, the perception and formation of the ground, the mingling of earth and sky in the weather-world, the experiences of light, sound and feeling, the role of storytelling in the integration of knowledge, and the potential of drawing to unite observation and description.</p> <p></p> <p>Our humanity, Ingold argues, does not come ready-made but is continually fashioned in our movements along ways of life. Starting from the idea of life as a process of wayfaring, Ingold presents a radically new understanding of movement, knowledge and description as dimensions not just of being in the world, but of being alive to what is going on there.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tim Ingold </strong>is Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Aberdeen, UK. He is the author of <em>The Perception of the Environment</em> and <em>Lines</em>.</p><p><strong>"For three decades, Tim Ingold&#x2019;s has been one of the most consistently exploratory and provocative voices in contemporary scholarship. This book leads us, in prose that is exactingly lucid and charged with poetic eloquence, on a journey through, amongst other things, Chinese calligraphy, line drawing, carpentry, kite flying, Australian Aboriginal painting, native Alaskan storytelling, web-spinning arachnids, the art of walking and, not least, the history of anthropology, none of which will ever look quite the same again! The work is at once a meditation on questions central to anthropology, art practice, human ecology and philosophy, a passionate rebuttal of reductionisms of all kinds, a celebration of creativity understood in the broadest possible sense and a humane and generous manual for living in a world of becoming."</strong></p> <p>- Stuart McLean, <em>University of Minnesota, USA</em></p> <p></p> <p><strong>"Simultaneously intimate and all-encompassing, Tim Ingold&#x2019;s second landmark collection of essays explains how it feels to craft an existence between earth and sky, among plants and animals, across childhood and old age. A master of the form, Ingold shows how aliveness is the essential resource for an affirmative philosophy of life."</strong></p> <p>- Hayden Lorimer, <em>University of Glasgow, UK</em></p> <p></p> <p><strong>"In these iconoclastic essays, Ingold breaks the dichotomies of likeness and difference to show that anthropology&#x2019;s subject, and with it that of the human sciences more generally, is not constituted by polarities like that of space contra place, but by a movement along paths that compose a being that is as alive to the sentient world as this world is to its human inhabitants."</strong></p> <p>- Kenneth Olwig, <em>Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</em></p></p><h2>Fashion in Film</h2><p>Fashion designers have been involved in movies since the early days of cinema.

This electric, programmable pressure cooker has long been an indispensable tool in my kitchen, especially when it comes to healthy cooking.<br><br>Healthy cooking means different things to different people. For me, the most important part is starting out with wholesome ingredients, and this book takes the guesswork out of choosing the right groceries. Its recipes draw from a palette of mostly whole-food ingredients, including fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables and fruits; beans; whole grains and whole-grain flours; grass-fed dairy; lean proteins; healthy oils and fats; and moderate amounts of natural sweeteners. When cooking starts with good ingredients, you end up with good food.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll find that when you use the Instant Pot, there is always some built-in downtime. That&#x2019;s what I love most about this appliance: once you&#x2019;ve closed the lid and selected a cooking program, you&#x2019;re free to get on with your day, tend to other kitchen tasks, or just relax for a bit while your meal cooks itself. It&#x2019;s changed the way I think about meal preparation and time management for the better, since there&#x2019;s so much more flexibility than with stove-top or oven recipes. Whether I&#x2019;ve planned ahead or need to whip up dinner.<br><br> In the chapters to come, you&#x2019;ll discover recipes for every meal of the day. Hearty breakfasts, vegetable-spiked rice and pasta dishes, and belly-warming soups are just the beginning. There&#x2019;s even a whole chapter of vegetarian main dishes (great if you eat a plant-based diet or you&#x2019;re just looking to incorporate some meatless Mondays into your routine), and some healthy spins on dessert favorites, such&nbsp;as cheesecake and chocolate cake brownies. And, of course, you&#x2019;ll find tried-and-true Instant Pot classics, including super-creamy mac &#x2019;n&#x2019; cheese (surprise, it&#x2019;s vegan!), smothered chicken (full of flavor yet skinless to cut down on calories and saturated fat), and a rib-sticking steak and bean chili to satisfy big appetites.<br><br> Once you get comfortable with your Instant Pot and its possibilities, it can be a real joy to venture beyond the classics and try out flavor combinations from around the world. After all, many international cuisines are packed with healthy recipes if you just know where to look. Beet Borscht (page 75) is a light yet comforting soup, and it&#x2019;s absolutely loaded with vegetables. Italian Braised Green Beans and Tomatoes (page 219) takes advantage of a few fragrant spices and cooks in just minutes. Chicken and Mushroom Goulash (page 166) is the epitome of the one-pot meal, with protein and vegetables cooked together.<br><br> &nbsp;Before you jump into the recipe chapters, I encourage you to check out the rest of this introductory section. Whether you&#x2019;re an Instant Pot novice (welcome!) or an old pro, you&#x2019;ll find some new information here. I&#x2019;ll go over the basics of how to use your Instant Pot and all of its functions; review the best tools, accessories, and pantry staples; and chat about shortcuts and tricks for getting healthy food on the table.<br><br> The purchase of an Instant Pot often comes with the hope of preparing more healthful, home-cooked meals. In our modern, busy lives, this versatile appliance can truly help you to accomplish your nutritional goals and feed your household nourishing meals. I hope that this cookbook provides you with plenty of guidance and inspiration, and helps you to make healthy Instant Pot cooking part of your routine.<br><br> I wish you a rewarding pressure cooking journey!</p><h2>Clinical Aromatherapy: Essential Oils in Practice, Second Edition</h2><p>Aromatherapy is one of the main complementary therapies to be practiced by nurses and other health care professionals in hospital, hospice, and community settings.

Throughout India to this day, Kali is worshipped as the destroyer of bondage, capable of liberating her devotee from all rules and subjugation. <br> <br>In <i>Tantric Kali</i>, Daniel Odier presents the mythology, practices, and rituals of Kali worship in the Tantric Kaula tradition within Kashmiri Shaivism. He reveals the practices of <i>Vamachara</i>, commonly known as the Left-hand Path but more accurately translated as the Path of Shakti. In this tradition the body itself is Kali&#x2019;s temple, and it is therefore unnecessary to reject or deny the body to know union with the divine. Instead, nothing is regarded as pure or impure and there is complete freedom from rules. Focused on working directly with forbidden emotions and behaviors, this path allows the seeker to transcend obstacles to liberation through sexual union. According to the Kaula Upanishad, &#x201c;In your behavior do the opposite to what the norms dictate but remain in consciousness.&#x201d; This is the essence of Tantra. Kali is absolute reality: manifested as woman intoxicated by desire, she frees the tantric practitioner from all desire except union with the divine. <br> <br>The author includes an evocative ritual from the Nirrutara Tantra--never before translated into any Western language--containing devotions to the 64 yoginis according to Matsyendranath, founder of the Kaula path. Offering devotional chants, meditations, and mudras specific to Tantric worship of Kali, this empowering book provides practices and teachings for those on the Tantric path to liberation.</p><p>Daniel Odier is a teacher of Tantra who received a mystical initiation from the tantric yogini, Lalita Devi.

Her crisp style and skillful observation of people and places gives her work lasting appeal.The Country of the Pointer Firs, Sarah Orne Jewett&#39;s masterpiece, established her among the consummate stylists of nineteenth-century American fiction. Composed in a series of beautiful web-like sketches, the novel is narrated by a young woman writer who unfolds a New England idyll rooted in friendship, particularly female friendship, weaving stories and conversations, imagery of sea, sky and earth, the tang of salt air and aromatic herbs into an historically significant &#39;fiction of community&#39; in which themes and form are exquisitely matched. This edition, introduced by Alison Easton, also includes ten of Sarah Orne Jewett&#39;s short stories, among them &#39;The Queen&#39;s Twin&#39;, &#39;The Foreigner&#39; and &#39;William&#39;s Wedding&#39;.</p><h2>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)</h2><p>One of the most magical concoctions in children's literature, Lewis Carroll's tale follows Alice into the upside-down, inside-out world of Wonderland where she attends the tea party of the Mad Hatter and plays croquet in the court of the Queen of Hearts<br></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

As a young genius living in a time before science as we know it existed, Isaac studied the few books he could get his hands on, built handmade machines, and experimented with alchemy&#x2014;a process of chemical reactions that seemed, at the time, to be magical. Mary Losure&#x2019;s riveting narrative nonfiction account of Isaac&#x2019;s early life traces his development as a thinker from his childhood, in friendly prose that will capture the attention of today&#x2019;s budding scientists&#x2014;as if by magic. Back matter includes an afterword, an author&#x2019;s note, source notes, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p><b>Mary Losure,</b> author of <i>The Fairy Ring</i> and <i>Wild Boy,</i> has worked as a reporter for Minnesota Public Radio and a contributor to National Public Radio.

Thus, the reader is left with the bare facts of Newton&#x2019;s life&#x2014;his difficult and troubled childhood, his prodigious talent at Cambridge, his prickly and reclusive nature, and his famous Laws of Motion&#x2014;but more importantly, Losure has communicated his very essence, recalling Albert Einstein&#x2019;s assertion that &#x201c;imagination is more important than knowledge.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Horn Book (starred review)<br><br>In this charming biography of Isaac Newton (1642&#x2013;1727), Losure (<i>Wild Boy</i>) posits that &#x201c;this last sorcerer&#x2014;this greatest of all alchemists&#x2014;was the same man who banished magic from the scientific world.&#x201d; ...

Whether the issue is Donald Trump, healthcare, abortion, gun control, breastfeeding, or even DC vs Marvel, it feels like you can't voice an opinion without ruffling someone's feathers. In today's digital age, it's easier than ever to build walls around yourself. You fill up your Twitter feed with voices that are angry about the same issues and believe as you believe. Before long, you're isolated in your own personalized echo chamber. And if you ever encounter someone outside of your bubble, you don't understand how the arguments that resonate so well with your peers can't get through to anyone else. In a time when every conversation quickly becomes a battlefield, it's up to us to learn how to talk to each other again. <br><br>In<i> Talking Across the Divide</i>, social justice activist Justin Lee explains how to break through the five key barriers that make people resist differing opinions. With a combination of psychological research, pop-culture references, and anecdotes from Justin's many years of experience mediating contentious conversations, this book will help you understand people on the other side of the argument and give you the tools you need to change their minds--even if they've fallen for "fake news."</p><p><b>Justin Lee</b>&nbsp;has spent more than twenty years building bridges between conservatives and progressives on matters of faith and public policy.

We disagree on race and religion, onscience and social issues&#x2014;but we don&#x2019;t just disagree; we&#x2019;re baffled by eachother&#x2019;s views, and we have no idea how to get through to one another. Partisanbickering has created a gridlocked government that struggles to get even widelysupported things done. Important scientific research is being stalled bycompeting groups&#x2019; agendas. Culture wars are fracturing our families and tearingour communities apart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like we live on different planets,&#x201d; my friend Ryansaid to me the other day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was talking about a rift between him and members ofhis family. They&#x2019;d been close at one time, he told me. But in recent years,they&#x2019;d found themselves more and more often on opposite sides of culturalbattles. They were bitterly divided by national politics, by matters of faithand morality, and by shifting cultural views on a variety of issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan wanted to be able to sit down with his family andtalk through their differences&#x2014;to help them understand where he was coming fromand to hopefully change their attitudes on the issues that mattered most tohim. But every time he tried talking to them, he just wound up frustrated.Their views didn&#x2019;t make any sense to him, his didn&#x2019;t make any sense to them,and every conversation seemed to wind up in an argument. Their communicationwas breaking down somewhere, and the rift between them was widening into anuncrossable chasm. Ryan had eventually fallen into the habit of swallowing hisemotions and trying to &#x201c;make nice&#x201d; at family events, but it was eating away athim. He couldn&#x2019;t help wondering what could have happened to cause the people heloved to be so stubborn and to see the world so differently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And Ryan&#x2019;s far from alone. I&#x2019;ve spent twenty yearsfocusing on divisive issues in our society, and in that time, I&#x2019;ve metthousands of people just like him&#x2014;people whose families, churches, communities,and workplaces are being torn apart by controversy and conflict, each sidebaffled by the other, each pointing to different &#x201c;facts&#x201d; and making differentassumptions. It is, as Ryan says, almost as if we live on different planets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Competing ideas have always been part of the American wayof life. Our political system is built on contests between differing ideas, andour Constitution reflects the hard-fought compromises of founders who did notsee eye to eye on everything. But those compromises wouldn&#x2019;t have happenedwithout communication across lines of disagreement, and our politicalmarketplace of ideas begins to fall apart if we&#x2019;re hearing completely differentversions of the truth from completely different sources. For this &#x201c;Americanexperiment&#x201d; to function, we have to be able to talk to one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But our attempts to communicate are failing, and nowhereis this more obvious than in the current state of American politics. Since1994, the Pew Research Center has studied America&#x2019;s political polarization, andin that time, the value divide between Republicans and Democrats has only grownlarger. In 2017, Pew found the largest partisan divide in the history of theirresearch&#x2014;a value gap nearly 250 percent as large as it had been.2 Meanwhile,hostility between the parties has skyrocketed.3 Fewer of us are moderate than everbefore, and as we drift toward the left or the right, most of us who identifyas either Democrats or Republicans report that we have &#x201c;just a few&#x201d; or no closefriends in the opposing party.4</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, though, our political troubles are only asymptom of the underlying disease. An us-vs.-them mentality is taking over ourpublic and private lives. Increasingly, we take our disagreements not to thepeople we disagree with but to our own echo chambers&#x2014;spaces where we can talkabout, rather than to, the other side&#x2014;where like-minded people echo our ownbeliefs right back to us. Our opponents, too, are stuck in their own echochambers, having their beliefs reinforced by people on their side rather thanbeing encouraged to consider what we have to say. That&#x2019;s a problem, becausesome of our biggest challenges as human beings require working together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Foot on Each Side of the Divide</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My own interest in this problem began with the issuesclosest to&nbsp;me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I grew up on a cultural battle line; I don&#x2019;t rememberever not being aware of the culture wars. I was raised in a conservative,evangelical Christian family, with a faith that has stayed with me my entirelife. I learned from a young age that my church held certain views on a varietyof controversial issues, and I quickly embraced those views as my own&#x2014;includinga staunch opposition to homosexuality. As a teenager, I tended to lecture myfriends on these issues, earning me the nickname God Boy, a badge I wore withpride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But puberty brought complications. I wasn&#x2019;t attracted togirls like my male friends were; I was attracted to guys. At eighteen, Ifinally had to admit to myself that I was gay, a realization that turned myevangelical life upside down and forced me to rethink a lot of what I thought Iknew about gay people. As I struggled to make sense of all the new information,I increasingly felt trapped between two worlds. And in college, when I madesome gay friends for the first time, it was easy to see how far apart these twoworlds were. My gay friends didn&#x2019;t understand my evangelical friends andfamily, and my evangelical friends and family didn&#x2019;t understand my gay friends.It was, indeed, as if we lived on different planets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I began speaking and writing about this faith-sexualitydivide, and soon I was hearing views on the subject from frustrated people allacross the spectrum. I started a nonprofit that worked successfully for sixteenyears to bridge the divide and bring families back together that had been tornapart by their disagreements. My first book, Torn: Rescuing the Gospel from theGays-vs.-Christians Debate, resulted in a flood of letters to me from parents,pastors, and others telling me that I had completely changed their opinion onthe topic. There was an advantage, I realized, to being caught between worlds:It made me culturally bilingual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, as I worked to bridge that divide, I foundmyself in the middle of many others. I was called in to consult withconservative faith leaders and progressive social-justice activists. I spoke tocrowds in rural towns and booming metropolises, in red states and blue. I gotto see the inside of other people&#x2019;s echo chambers and to hear what they saidwhen &#x201c;the other side&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t present&#x2014;and hours later, I might be in a room ofpeople on that other side, listening to them do the exact same thing. Theissues these groups raised weren&#x2019;t just about faith and sexuality. They wereabout race and gender, guns and abortion, personal struggles and publicpolicy&#x2014;and all sorts of other issues that divide us. These are issues we can&#x2019;tafford to get wrong, and yet I watched as these groups consistently struggledto get through to one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We each have issues that matter most to us. You may notbe passionate about the faith-sexuality divide like I am&#x2014;you might evendisagree with me entirely&#x2014;but you have your own positions and issues that areimportant to you. Maybe there&#x2019;s a political or social topic you&#x2019;d really liketo change some people&#x2019;s minds about. Maybe it&#x2019;s a religious disagreement oreven a personal squabble affecting people close to you. But while the specificsof our issues may be different, the principles of communication and change arethe same. We need to be able to communicate across our lines of disagreement,but instead, we keep ending up in fights that go nowhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Theoretically, we&#x2019;re all fighting for the truth as we seeit&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s reasonable! We should do our best for truth, justice, andgoodness. Ironically, though, as we fight one another over the truth, the truthis what&#x2019;s being lost. In an echo-chamber world, objective truth carries lessweight than truth-as-defined-by-my-social-circles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What&#x2019;s Led to This Polarization?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an internet age, it seems like we should be moreconnected than ever. But in some ways, the very technology that now connects usaround the world may be at least partly to blame for pulling us apart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before the internet, our social circles were muchsmaller. Consider someone living in a rural area in the 1950s. Their optionsfor socializing would be mostly limited to their family, their neighbors, andpeople they knew from school or work. This made it important for that person tofind ways to resolve any disputes that arose within those social circles,because without those circles, there weren&#x2019;t a lot of other people to spendtime with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The internet has changed that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In some ways, that&#x2019;s a really good thing. As a gay teenin an evangelical family, I felt very alone and isolated until I found supporton the internet. Lots of people with unique needs or interests have foundcommunities of their own online or even used the internet to find like-mindedlocals whom they might never have met in their usual social circles. I love thepower of the internet to connect people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it also comes at a cost. Social media apps make itpossible for us to build vast networks of friends and then unceremoniously droppeople from our lives the moment we have a dispute. If the person sittingacross the table from me says something to irritate me, I can whip out myphone, fire off a message, and get instant sympathy and support from friendsaround the world who will assure me that of course I&#x2019;m right, and I don&#x2019;t needthat person&#x2019;s drama in my life anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, it&#x2019;s great to get support when something badhappens. Sometimes we do need others to encourage us to get away from a bad orabusive relationship. But this also makes it easy for us to give up too quicklyon resolving disputes with people who simply see things differently from us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you don&#x2019;t agree with my politics, my identity, or myview of the world, I can easily block you or push you away and spend more timewith the social circles who affirm what I already believe. That constant streamof approval is intoxicating and addictive. And we don&#x2019;t just get it on socialmedia. We choose news sources, places of worship, and even forms ofentertainment that affirm our existing views and demonize those people outthere. Before we know it, we&#x2019;re living in echo chambers where we hear the sameperspectives over and over and over, all of us reinforcing one another in thesense that we are the chosen ones, we are the &#x201c;good guys,&#x201d; and the people outthere who would oppose us are the enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And it&#x2019;s not that we never interact with those people&#x2014;ofcourse we still do&#x2014;but we find them making less and less sense to us. We justdon&#x2019;t get them anymore. They seem incredibly out of touch with reality as weand our social circles know it to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And one day, we wake up to find that we&#x2019;re so far apartthat we don&#x2019;t even know how to talk to one another anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And we wonder when they got like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Us-Colored Glasses</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s not just the conscious choices we make that areseparating us from one another. There&#x2019;s something else pulling us apart, andmany of us aren&#x2019;t even aware of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In his 2011 book The Filter Bubble, Eli Pariser arguedthat technology is creating an individually personalized &#x201c;filter bubble&#x201d; foreach of us&#x2014;a bubble that filters everything we see on the internet, showing usan altered version of reality based on what computer algorithms think we want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You and I might both use Google to search for the exactsame terms, but we&#x2019;ll get different results. Why? Because Google doesn&#x2019;t justpresent you with a list of the most popular links. It gives you a list of theinformation it thinks you want based on everything it knows about you,including your location and your past searches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an experiment for his book, Pariser asked two friendsto each search Google for the term &#x201c;BP&#x201d; during that company&#x2019;s much-publicized2010 oil spill. But even though Pariser&#x2019;s friends were both searching for thesame term, what they got back was drastically different. For instance, only oneof them saw news about the oil spill in her first page of results, while theother saw investment information. Google&#x2019;s invisible algorithms showed eachwoman what Google thought she wanted to see. With personalized search engines,the same question gives different people different answers.5</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that matters, because these days, most of us go tosearch engines with our most important questions. When we want to know what istrue and what isn&#x2019;t, we search online. So if search engines are giving usdifferent answers depending on who&#x2019;s doing the asking, that doesn&#x2019;t help usarrive together at the truth. It just pulls us further apart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Pariser puts it:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Google personalized for everyone, the query &#x201c;stemcells&#x201d; might produce diametrically opposed results for scientists who supportstem cell research and activists who oppose it. &#x201c;Proof of climate change&#x201d; mightturn up different results for an environmental activist and an oil companyexecutive. In polls, a huge majority of us assume search engines are unbiased.But that may be just because they&#x2019;re increasingly biased to share our ownviews. More and more, your computer monitor is a kind of one-way mirror,reflecting your own interests while algorithmic observers watch what youclick.6</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And this isn&#x2019;t just limited to search engines. You and Icould have the same Facebook friends, but we won&#x2019;t see the same posts when welog on. Like Google, Facebook shows us what it thinks we want to see, based onaccumulated data like what we&#x2019;ve clicked in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means that social media sites like Facebook candoubly skew our view of the world. We&#x2019;re starting from a biased sample to beginwith, because the news we see on Facebook is determined by who our Facebookfriends are, and most of us tend to have Facebook friends who are similar to usand who agree with us on the issues we care about most. Sure, you probablydon&#x2019;t agree with all your Facebook friends on everything, but most people&#x2019;sFacebook friend lists are skewed in the direction of being like them in termsof race, religion, location, socioeconomic status, political views, and so on.</p></p><h2>The Only Freedom</h2><p>The Only Freedom reveals the possibility of attaining a state of permanent freedom. It is not the freedom we experience when we recover from some disease, for in that state we always know or expect that some other ailment can afflict us. It is not the freedom from lack that a wonderful new job or large inheritance may bring, for these also can fail us. The freedom described in The Only Freedom is a freedom already within us, but which can be reached only through the discipline of knowing the truth &#x2013; the truth about God, man, and the nature of error &#x2013; and standing firmly in the principles behind these truths. As Goldsmith says, &#x201c;If we are not abiding in the Word and letting the Word abide in us, all the evils of this world can come near our dwelling place.&#x201d;Throughout this book Goldsmith shows us how to find &#x201c;the liberty of the sons of God&#x201d; within ourselves. He says that it may not be easy, but that freedom and fulfillment will be the end result: &#x201c;Wherever there is a realization of God, man is given his freedom, not only spiritual freedom, but a spiritual freedom which becomes evident as physical, mental, moral and financial freedom.&#x201d;[Note: The Only Freedom is the collection of the 1981 Infinite Way Letters.]</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;<p>"A new generation of mature seekers, receptive to spiritual truth, is now discovering Joel Goldsmith's teachings, which have lost none of their relevance, aliveness and power. I foresee that those teachings will reach and impact even more people in the 21st century than during his lifetime. Joel Goldsmith's inspired and profoundly inspiring books represent a vital contribution to the spiritual awakening of humanity." </p><p>-- Eckhart Tolle</p></p><h2>Druid Animal Oracle - Trade Paperback</h2><p>Bring the power of Ancient Druid wisdom into your life today.<br><br>You are holding a source of great power and influence -- the wisdom of the animal world drawn from the wellspring of ancient Celtic tradition.

Knowledge of chemistry leads to better understanding about the hazards and benefits of this world, enabling better personal decision-making. This comprehensive yet simply written book covers the gamut of chemistry topics, including: drugs, biocides, food additives, fertilizers, fuels, detergents, cosmetics, plastics, toxic wastes, polluted air and water, and dwindling petroleum reserves. By introducing current and timely topics, this book enables the reader to relate chemistry to themselves. For anyone interested in learning about chemistry and its effect upon our everyday lives.</p><p>This best-selling text for liberal arts chemistry through six editions continues to feature unparalled writing and excellent applications. An active member of the chemical education community, Doris Kolb brings a wealth of experience and a fresh perspective as co-author to this market- defining text. Colorful and appealing, the Seventh Edition updates applications, streamlines the overall organization, and adds exciting new resources through unique collaborations with the New York Times and ABC News. Most importantly, the seventh edition builds upon a rich tradition of responding to changing student profiles and modern teaching strategies.Preface <p> Chemistry for Changing Times is now in its ninth edition. Times have indeed changed since the first edition appeared in 1972, and the book has changed accordingly. Our knowledge base has expanded enormously since that first edition, yet we have resisted the pressure to increase the size of the book. This has forced us to make some tough choices in deciding what to include and what to leave out. We live in what has been called the "information age." Our main focus, therefore, is not so much on providing information as it is on helping students evaluate that information. </p><p> We believe that a chemistry course for students who are not majoring in science should be quite different from the course we offer our science majors. It should present basic chemical concepts with intellectual honesty, but it should not focus on esoteric theories or rigorous mathematics. It should include lots of modern everyday applications. The textbook should be appealing to look at, easy to understand, and interesting to read. </p><p> Three-fourths of the legislation considered by the U. S. Congress involves questions having to do with science or technology, yet only rarely does a scientist or engineer enter politics. Most of the people who make important decisions regarding our health and our environment are not trained in science, but it is critical that these decision makers are scientifically literate. A chemistry course for students who are not science majors should emphasize practical applications of chemistry to problems involving such things as environmental pollution, radioactivity, energy sources, and human health. The students who take our liberal arts chemistry courses include future teachers, lawyers, accountants, journalists, and judges. There are probably some future legislators, too. Objectives </p><p> Our main objectives in a chemistry course for students who are not majoring in science are as follows: </p><p></p><p>To attract as many students as possible. If students are not enrolled in the course, we can't teach them. To use topics of current interest to illustrate chemical principles. We want students to appreciate the importance of chemistry in the real world. To relate chemical problems to the everyday lives of our students. Chemical problems seem more significant to students if they can see a personal connection. To instill in students an appreciation for chemistry as an open-ended learning experience. We hope that our students will want to continue learning throughout their lives. To acquaint students with scientific methods. We want students to be able to read about science and technology with some degree of critical judgment. To help students become literate in science. We want our students to develop a comfortable knowledge of science so that they find news articles relating to science interesting rather than intimidating. New Features in the Ninth Edition </p><p> In response to suggestions from users and reviewers of the eighth edition, as well as using our own writing and teaching experience, we have thoroughly updated all the text to reflect the latest scientific knowledge. The organization of the 20 chapters remains much the same as in the eighth edition. The major exception lies within Chapters 5 and 6. Changes in Content </p><p> Some of the more important changes are as follows:</p><p>Chapter 6 was substantially revised and has a new title, "Chemical Accounting: Mass and Volume Relationships." We have concentrated much of the quantitative material in this one chapter. We moved the sections on naming chemical compounds from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. We moved the kinetic-molecular theory from Chapter 5 to Chapter 6. At the request of several users and reviewers, we have added a new section (Section 6.7) on solutions. This addition includes new worked-out examples, exercises, and end-of-chapter problems. We revised much of the early treatment of acid-base chemistry (Chapter 7), making the Br�nsted-Lowry treatment more explicit. We added a discussion of half-reactions in Chapter 7, with new worked-out examples, exercises, and end-of-chapter problems. We added a brief discussion of IUPAC naming in Chapter 9. In Chapter 13 we added a brief subsection, "Calculations of Parts per Billion," including a new worked-out example and end-of-chapter problems. We have added new tables and reorganized others. New tables include Physical Properties, Chemical Properties, Potential Energy, and Kinetic Energy (Chapter 1); Mendeleev's Original Periodic Table (Chapter 2); Types of Radiation, Differences Between Chemical and Nuclear Reactions, and Symbols for Subatomic Particles (Chapter 4). Additions to Pedagogy </p><p> The following changes have been made to strengthen and improve the pedagogy in this edition.</p><p>We follow worked-out examples by A and B exercises in some cases. The B exercise is intended to be a bit more challenging, often requiring a knowledge of material from earlier in the book. To improve the organization of the text, we use superheads in some chapters. We use voice balloons in problem solving to carefully guide the student through the process and thus improve the pedagogy. Focusing on the importance of providing interesting, relevant applications, we have added several new box features: Cost-Benefit Analysis and Health Care and Body Temperature, Hypothermia, and Hyperthermia (Fever) (Chapter 1); What a Difference an O Makes, and Recycling (Chapter 2); What Makes for Nuclear Stablility? (Chapter 4); Who's Number Is It Anyway? (Chapter 6); Conducting Polymers: Polyacetylene (Chapter 10); Asbestos: Risks and Benefits (Chapter 11); Air Pollution in China, An Air Pollution Episode: London, England, and Wood Smoke (Chapter 12); and Entropy (Chapter 14). We have updated the References and Readings at the end of each chapter. We continue to include Critical Thinking exercises at the end of each chapter. We have chosen several new photographs and produced new diagrams to improve the pedagogy and the visual appeal of the book. Web-Related Activities For this ninth edition, we have added 12 MediaLabs, which are spread throughout the text and placed appropriately after the chapter to which they relate. Examples include: Chapter 9 MediaLab&#x2014;Fragrances: Stop and Smell the Roses, Chapter 15 MediaLab&#x2014;Genetic Recombination&#x2014;Promise or Peril?, and Chapter 18 MediaLab&#x2014;Keeping Fit or Overexerting? These MediaLabs help tie the chapter topics to current events and use the power of the internet to explore those events. For this ninth edition, a major change is that we have added web references with brief descriptions as margin notes within each chapter. They can be accessed through the Chemistry for Changing Times World Wide Web Center (prenhall/hillkolb/). We have also added interesting Online Projects at the end of each chapter that may be assigned as a collaborative group or individual activity. Use of Color </p><p> New color photographs and diagrams have been added. Visual material adds greatly to the general appeal of a textbook. Color diagrams can also be highly instructive, and colorful photographs relating to descriptive chemistry do much to enhance the learning process. Readability </p><p> Over the years, students have told us that they have found this textbook easy to read. The language is simple, and the style is conversational. Explanations are clear and easy to understand. The friendly tone of the book has been maintained in this edition. Units of Measurement </p><p> The United States continues to cling to the traditional English system for many kinds of measurement even though the metric system has long been used internationally. A modern version of the metric system, the Syst�me International (SI), is now widely used, especially by scientists. So what units should be used in a text for liberal arts students? In presenting chemical principles, we use primarily metric units. In other parts of the book we use those units that the students are most likely to encounter elsewhere in the same context. Chemical Structures </p><p> The structures of many complicated molecules are presented in the text, especially in the later chapters. These structures are presented mainly to emphasize that they are actually known and to illustrate the fact that substances with similar properties often have similar structures. Students should not feel that they must learn all these structures, but they should take the time to look at them. We hope that they will come to recognize familiar features in these molecules. Glossary </p><p> The Glossary (Appendix B) gives definitions of terms that appear in boldface throughout the text. These terms include all key terms listed at the end of each chapter. Questions and Problems </p><p> The end-of-chapter exercises include review questions, a set of matched-pair problems, and suggested projects and online projects. Answers to many review questions and to all the odd-numbered problems are given in Appendix C. Problems are given within some of the chapters, with worked-out examples followed by similar exercises. Answers to all the in-chapter exercises are also given in Appendix C.

With essays covering topics as diverse as animal rights, extinction, deforestation, terrorism and overpopulation, Can Life Prevail? makes the lucid, challenging writing of Linkola available to the English-speaking public for the first time. &#34;By decimating its woodlands, Finland has created the grounds for prosperity. We can now thank prosperity for bringing us - among other things - two million cars, millions of glowing, electronic entertainment boxes, and many unneeded buildings to cover the green earth. Surplus wealth has led to gambling in the marketplace and rampant social injustice, whereby &#39;the common people&#39; end up contributing to the construction of golf courses, five-star hotels, and holiday resorts, while fattening Swiss bank accounts. Besides, the people of wealthy countries are the most frustrated, unemployed, unhappy, suicidal, sedentary, worthless and aimless people in history.

In this groundbreaking study, prejudices toward the simplicity and "naivet�" of Chinese thought, Hegelian and otherwise, are dismantled one by one to reveal the intricate and coherent structure underlying Chinese modes of thinking and representing reality. </p><p>Jullien begins with a single Chinese term, shi, whose very ambivalence and disconcerting polysemy, on the one hand, and simple efficacy, on the other, defy the order of a concept. Yet shi insinuates itself into the ordering and conditioning of reality in all its manifold and complex representations. Because shi neither gave rise to any coherent, general analysis nor figured as one of the major concepts among Chinese thinkers, Jullien follows its appearance from one field to another: from military strategy to politics; from the aesthetics of calligraphy and painting to the theory of literature; and from reflection on history to "first philosophy." At the point where these various domains intersect, a fundamental intuition assumed self-evident for centuries emerges, namely, that reality - every kind of reality - may be perceived as a particular deployment or arrangement of things to be relied upon and worked to one's advantage. Art or wisdom, as conceived by the Chinese, lies in strategically exploiting the propensity that emanates from this particular configuration of reality.</p></p><p>Fran�ois Jullien is Professor at the Universit� Paris VII-Denis Diderot and director at the Institut de la Pens�e Contemporaine.

First published over a century ago, the methods, &#34;tricks of the trade&#34; and shortcuts Silvanus Thompson reveals are as applicable today in solving real-world 21st century problems. Whether you are a student, an established professional, or simply curious, this easy-to-follow book will give you the confidence to attack even the most daunting problems in engineering, science or mathematics.</p><p>Praise for Martin Gardner's New Edition of <i>Calculus Made Easy</i>: <p>"Martrin Gardner is one of the greatest intellects produced in this country in this century." --Douglas Hofstadter </p><p>"Sylvanus Thompson's <i>Calculus Made Easy</i> is arguably the best math teaching ever. To a non-mathematician, its simplicity and clarity reveals the mathematical genius of Newton, Leibniz, and Thompson himself. Martin Gardner deserves huge thanks for renewing this great book." --Julian Simon, author of <i>Population Matters</i> </p><p>"A remarkable and original user-friendly approach to the study of calculus, made even more so by Martin Gardner, the most highly acclaimed mathematical expositor of out time." --R.L. Graham, Chief Scientist, AT&amp;T Labs, and author of <i>Concrete Mathematics</i> </p><p>"Before the epsilons and deltas of a college course taught by an eminent mathematician, I learned the elements of calculus from S.P.

Martin Gardner, The "Mathematical Games" columnist for <i>Scientific American</i> for over a quarter of a century, is the perfect mathematician to make calculus easy once again. <p>Calculus, though usually seen as the most challenging subject faced by a math student, does not have to be impossible. Silvanus P. Thompson wrote <i>Calculus Made Easy</i> nearly ninety years ago to show that differential and integral calculus is in fact not difficult at all. Thompson believed that once a reader has grasped the basic principles of differentiation and integration, the rest of calculus will follow naturally. The books continuing popularity over the years is proof of his complete success. </p><p>In the first major revision of <i>Calculus Made Easy</i> since 1921, Gardner has thoroughly updated the text to reflect recent developments in method and terminology, written an extensive preface and three new introductory chapters, and added more than twenty recreational problems for practice and enjoyment. </p><p><i>Calculus Made Easy</i>, already the preeminent primer for the average reader, a book that has sold over one million copies, has become even more accessible and informative in the masterful hands of one of the twentieth century's greatest thinkers.</p></p><h2>Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine (Check info AND delete this occurrence: |c OXHMED |t Oxford Handbooks Series)</h2><p>As ubiquitous in hospitals as stethoscopes, the <em>Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine</em> is a guiding star for all medical students, junior doctors, and residents.

Drawing on the author&#x2019;s academic research into Quaker uses of religious language and her teaching to Quaker and academic groups, Rhiannon Grant aims to make accessible some key theological and philosophical insights. She explains that Quakers might sound vague but are actually making clear and creative theological claims. Theology isn't just for wordy people or intellectuals, it's for everyone. And that's important because our religious language is related to, not separate from, our religious experience. It also becomes clear that denying other people's claims often leads to making your own and that even apparently negative positions can also be making positive statements. How do Quakers tell the truth about God? This book explores this key theological process through fourteen short chapters. As Quakers, we say that we know some things, but not very much, about God, and that we are in a constant process of trying to improve our ways of saying what we do know.</p></p><p><p>Rhiannon Grant is tutor of Quaker Roles at Woodbrooke Quaker study centre and is the Deputy Programmes Leader for the Centre for Research in Quaker Studies, where she teaches on Modern Quaker Thought. Her research includes work on Quaker uses of religious language and changing Quaker practices.

A monstrous brute by the name of Hyde prowls the streets, leaving a lascivious wake of brutality and violence and where Hyde treads, the mild mannered and sophisticated Dr. Jekyll is not far behind to pay for the damages. Dr. Jekyll&#39;s friend, Gabriel John Utterson, slowly begins to piece the mystery behind Dr. Jekyll&#39;s relationship to the unscrupulous Hyde but it isn&#39;t until he makes a startling discovery that the truth is revealed.</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

After decades of marriage, Mom and Dad are still in love--and the proud parents of a brood of youngsters that includes a star athlete, a class valedictorian, and a popular cheerleader. Home is an idyllic place called High Point Farm. And the bonds of attachment within this all-American clan do seem both deep and unconditional: "Mom paused again, drawing in her breath sharply, her eyes suffused with a special lustre, gazing upon her family one by one, with what crazy unbounded love she gazed upon us, and at such a moment my heart would contract as if this woman who was my mother had slipped her fingers inside my rib cage to contain it, as you might hold a wild, thrashing bird to comfort it."<p> But as we all know, Eden can't last forever. And in the hands of Joyce Carol Oates, who's chronicled just about every variety of familial dysfunction, you know the fall from grace is going to be a doozy. By the time all is said and done, a rape occurs, a daughter is exiled, much alcohol is consumed, and the farm is lost. Even to recount these events in retrospect is a trial for the Mulvaney offspring, one of whom declares: "When I say this is a hard reckoning I mean it's been like squeezing thick drops of blood from my veins." In the hands of a lesser writer, this could be the stuff of a bad television movie. But this is Oates's 26th novel, and by now she knows her material and her craft to perfection. <i>We Were the Mulvaneys</i> is populated with such richly observed and complex characters that we can't help but care about them, even as we wait for disaster to strike them down. <i>--Anita Urquhart</i></p>In addition to many prize-winning and bestselling novels, JOYCE CAROL OATES is the author of a number of works of award-winning gothic fiction.

There are seemingly irresolvable differences in the beliefs, values, and identities of citizens across the country that too often play out in our legal system in clashes on a range of topics such as the tensions between law enforcement and minority communities. How can we possibly argue for civic aspirations like tolerance, humility, and patience in our current moment?<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Confident Pluralism</i>, John D. Inazu analyzes the current state of the country, orients the contemporary United States within its broader history, and explores the ways that Americans can&#x2014;and must&#x2014;strive to live together peaceably despite our deeply engrained differences. Pluralism is one of the founding creeds of the United States&#x2014;yet America&#x2019;s society and legal system continues to face deep, unsolved structural problems in dealing with differing cultural anxieties and differing viewpoints. Inazu not only argues that it is possible to cohabitate peacefully in this country, but also lays out realistic guidelines for our society and legal system to achieve the new American dream through civic practices that value toleration over protest, humility over defensiveness, and persuasion over coercion.<br><br> The paperback edition includes a new preface that addresses the election of Donald Trump, the decline in civic discourse after the election, the Nazi march in Charlottesville, and more, this new edition of <i>Confident Pluralism</i>&nbsp;is an essential clarion call during one of the most troubled times in US history. Inazu argues for institutions that can work to bring people together as well as political institutions that will defend the unprotected. &nbsp;<i>Confident Pluralism</i>&nbsp;offers a refreshing argument for how the legal system can protect peoples&#x2019; personal beliefs and differences and provides a path forward to a healthier future&nbsp;of tolerance, humility, and patience.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>John D. Inazu</b> is the Sally D. Danforth Distinguished Professor of Law and Religion at Washington University in St. Louis."Into this polluted political atmosphere comes a different sort of academic. Inazu is proposing a national cleanup effort to make our&nbsp;public life more pleasant and productive....We should not downplay the&nbsp;stakes. Tolerance, humility and patience are not&nbsp;the ornaments of a democracy,&nbsp;they are its essence.&#x201d; (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>"The 2016 presidential election, assuming both Clinton and Trump are the nominees, may well be the ugliest and most vicious election many of us will have ever seen. There&#x2019;s no easy or quick way out of this. It will require some large number of Americans to re-think how we are to engage in politics in this era of rage and polarization. Toward that end, Inazu has written <i>Confident Pluralism</i>. It&#x2019;s so unfashionable, so unrealistic, so <i>out of touch</i>. It&#x2019;s chic to be cynical. Except for this: Disagreeing with others, even passionately disagreeing with others, without rhetorically vaporizing them is actually part of what it means to live as citizens in a republic. The choice is co-existence with some degree of mutual respect&#x2014;or the politics of resentment and disaffection, the politics of hate and de-humanization." (<i>Commentary Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Inazu&#x2019;s book should be read by all who desire a more civil, thoughtful society than the one in which we find ourselves." (<i>First Things</i>)<br><br>"<i>Confident Pluralism</i>&nbsp;is an illuminating account of how the American experiment, in both law and culture (and the&nbsp;intersections of the two), might help us foster a modest unity of public goals. &nbsp;Inazu surveys relevant constitutional doctrines&#x2014;the right to associate, the features of the public forum, the vexed legal&nbsp;dimensions of public funding&#x2014;with a brevity that also manages to be thorough and clear. his discussion of civic culture is aspirational and guardedly optimistic, but not Pollyannaish.&#x201d; (<i>Comment Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Inazu has presented an accessible and thoughtful case for pluralism in&nbsp;contemporary America. It will not convince all the skeptics. But perhaps it can&nbsp;start a conversation that will continue in the spirit with which Inazu wrote:&nbsp;confidently putting forward ideas, and considering alternatives with humility,&nbsp;patience, and generosity.&#x201d; (<i>The New Rambler</i>)<br><br>"Inazu's vision is an attractive one, and we would all be better off if our political&nbsp;institutions were less eager to intervene in our associational lives&#x2014;and if those&nbsp;associational (and private) lives were characterized more by tolerance,&nbsp;humility, and patience.&#x201d; (<i>Books &amp; Culture</i>)<br><br>"Inazu offers an important new consideration of the value of pluralism for American democratic society.&nbsp;Confident pluralism, Inazu explains, is a political solution to the problem of deep and pervasive differences in the electorate. It recognizes difference and even invites it while acknowledging the need for consensus and unity in political life. The end goal of confident pluralism is not to resolve all issues but to allow individuals to function despite their differences. Highly Recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"It is abundantly clear that we have become a deeply divided country....This country no longer has one clear majority. Inazu explores the ways Americans can live together peaceably despite these deeply ingrained differences." (<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i>)<br><br>"This country no longer has one clear majority.

J. Evans, Ph.D., longtime Sitchin friend and colleague, provides an in-depth analysis of Sitchin&#x2019;s revelations about the Anunnaki, focusing on Anunnaki activities on Earth and Earth&#x2019;s future. She explores the genesis of Sitchin&#x2019;s interest in the Nefilim, the leaders of the Anunnaki, and the controversy caused by the publication of Sitchin&#x2019;s first book, <i>The 12th Planet</i>. She examines Sitchin&#x2019;s research into the Nefilim family tree, the Anunnaki arrival on Earth to mine gold to repair the atmosphere on their planet, Nibiru, and their creation of modern humans as workers for their mines and to build their civilization on Earth. She shows how, in the context of 21st-century technological capabilities, Sitchin&#x2019;s work casts a different light on ancient events, with implications for our future. The author reveals the details of the love and lust proclivities of the Nefilim gods Anu, Enlil, and Enki and the goddess Ishtar/Inanna and shows how we inherited these tendencies from our Anunnaki creators as well as their use of war for problem solving.<br><br>Concluding with an examination of Sitchin&#x2019;s prediction of a nuclear event on Earth in 2024 AD, she shows how we would be repeating the aggressive warlike behaviors of our Anunnaki creators, who may very well become our saviors when Nibiru next returns to our solar system.</p><p>M.

This question is challenging--wrapped as it is in debate. It also is as exciting a question as it is captivating. This query&#x2019;s wording presumes that a human species lived elsewhere in the universe and someone or something brought humanoid life here. Could that be possible? Or are there other explanations to be found for human existence on planet Earth? <br> <br>While Zecharia Sitchin does <i>not </i>entertain this question in just the way we first posed it, his research into the ancient clay tablet writings does tell us &#x201c;All the Sumerian texts assert that the gods created Man.&#x201d; Also the biblical evidence indicates that man was not a god nor was he created in the heavens. It was clear that while humans lacked the godly characteristics of &#x201c;knowing&#x201d; and &#x201c;longevity,&#x201d; they were &#x201c;in all other respects created in the image (<i>selem</i>) and likeness (<i>dmut</i>) of [their] Creator(s). The use of both terms in the text was meant to leave no doubt that Man was similar to the God(s) both physically and emotionally, externally and internally.&#x201d; <br> <br>These comments are very enlightening. However, Sitchin goes on to wonder &#x201c;how could a new creature possibly be a virtual physical, mental, and emotional replica of the Nefilim? How, indeed, was Man created?&#x201d; We will follow a fact-focused exploration into Sitchin&#x2019;s research to see where it leads and what we can learn about this fascinating topic of the <i>creation of humans</i>. <br> <br><b>The Debate about Our Origins</b> <br> <br>Undoubtedly, knowing the origins of the human species that now populate planet Earth is important. This topic has been long studied by physical anthropologists, genetic scientists, and others curious about how humans originated. It has also prompted heated disputes. We will attempt to unwrap this contentious debate here. Essentially this discussion asks: Did the God of the Bible &#x201c;create&#x201d; humans from some substance found on Earth? Or did the forces of nature work a progressive developmental change on a primeval creature who, very slowly, underwent genetic change by processes called <i>mutation </i>and <i>natural selection</i>, as put forward in the writings of the English naturalist Charles Darwin? <br> <br>While evolutionary scientists may believe that human genetic change has been occurring across the thousands of millennia of life on Earth, evidence to lock down this explanation of how progress (or change) occurs in humans is scarce. Would such slow changes lead to today&#x2019;s intelligent humans? Even if one looked for cognitive change beginning with Stone Age man (600,000 or even fewer years ago), it is doubtful that evolutionary change would provide unambiguous evidence that would result in today&#x2019;s intellectually capable and creative humans. There just has not been sufficient time for the types of change that differentiate primitive beings (Neanderthal) from the modern (Cro-Magnon) human species--<i>Homo sapiens</i> <i>sapiens</i>--to have occurred. <br> <br>If Darwin&#x2019;s explanation is not realistic, what other source can be used to document the origin of modern humans? Is it possible there is another answer to how modern intelligent humans came into existence? Sitchin&#x2019;s research tells us that the answer to that question is &#x201c;yes.&#x201d; According to him there is biblical and anthropological evidence to support another explanation. In his characteristic way, Sitchin followed his inclination to find answers to clues contained in the ancient clay tablet records; he was able to penetrate the tablet language to uncover evidence documenting that <i>Homo sapiens</i> developed by genetic manipulation carried out by the Nefilim--those advanced space travelers who arrived on Earth from another planet some 445,000 years ago and did their genetic work 300,000 years ago. <br> <br><b>The Sitchin Evidence of Human Creation</b> <br> <br>Sitchin tells us that the evidence clearly indicates that <i>deliberate genetic modification</i> explains the appearance of modern intellectual humans on Earth. He weighs in as a critic of the sweeping implications of the Darwinian explanations, and his message helps us see the flaws in the reasoning that points to a slow developmental trajectory. <br> <br>Evolution can explain the general course of events that caused life and life&#x2019;s forms to develop on Earth from the simplest one-celled creature to Man. But evolution cannot account for the appearance of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, which happened virtually overnight in terms of the millions of years evolution requires, and with no evidence of earlier stages that would indicate a gradual change from <i>Homo erectus</i>. <br> <br>The tablet evidence clearly indicates that <i>Homo sapiens</i> was a result of genetic manipulation by a Nefilim scientific team because they needed our kind (intelligent willing workers) to rectify a labor shortage at their gold mines. <br> <br>The following excerpt is spoken by the leader of those space travelers: <br> <br><i>I will produce a lowly Primitive; <br>&#x201c;Man&#x201d; shall be his name. <br>I will create a Primitive Worker; <br>He will be charged with service of the gods, <br>That they might have their ease.</i> <br> <br>The advanced scientific knowledge of the two Nefilim scientists--Enki and Ninhursag--was used to solve a very real labor problem, and we humans are the legacy of their creativity. Importantly, they did not develop the human being out of nothing. Sitchin&#x2019;s words here give us the most profound statement we find in any of his several books, and they will serve as a beacon to guide our inquiry deeper into this topic. He makes it clear that the human &#x201c;origins debate&#x201d; is not an either-or issue, but derives, in actuality, from <i>both </i>explanations. Sitchin states: <br> <br>Man is the product of evolution; but modern Man, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, is the product of the &#x201c;gods.&#x201d; For, some time circa 300,000 years ago, the Nefilim took ape-man (<i>Homo erectus</i>) and implanted on him their own image and likeness.&#x201d; <br> <br>In plain words, humans evolved <i>and </i>were created. An evolved being was used as the raw material, and genes from an Anunnaki were added to create the perfect being--us. Enki and Ninhursag did this through using their knowledge of <i>genetic engineering</i>. This information is profound and carries deep implications.</p><h2>Adventures in English Literature, 1989 (Grade 12) Pegasus Edition</h2><p>Good condition.

The collection includes painterly poems, love poems, poems spun off of Greek mythology and Christian iconography, but at all times the work remains contemporary and strikingly self-assured. In "Luncheon on the Grass," for example, the speaker ruminates in precise, idiomatic and witty language on the awkward position of the nude woman in Manet's painting. The real surprise comes as the speaker continues: "Now, in a comparable state of outdoor / undress, I'm beginning to have a fair idea / of what's going on in that scene. . . ." By employing an unusual perspective, Phillips thus opens the material up in both perverse and fascinating ways. This technique governs the entire text; it lends intellectual strength to the work and allows Phillips to examine complicated and contradictory issues. In one of the most moving poems Phillips compares "the Famous Black Poet" to his father: " . . . his is the same unnervingly slow / rambling method of getting from A to B . . . " Phillips has developed his own painful but luminous method for traveling that trajectory, and it will be most interesting to see where it takes him from here. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Physics of Radiation Therapy</h2><p>This leading reference source devoted to radiation therapy physics is now in its Third Edition.

We do it every day. "You won't believe what happened at work." Or "Guess what I just did!" Or "A guy goes into a bar ..." We see, hear, read, and tell thousands of stories in our lives.The problem comes in telling a great story. If you want to become a master storyteller, and maybe even get paid to be one, you run up against tremendous obstacles. For one thing, showing the how and why of human life is a monumental job. You have to have a deep and precise understanding of the biggest, most complex subject there is. And then you have to be able to translate your understanding into a story. For most writers, that may be the biggest challenge of all.I want to be specific about the obstacles of story technique because that's the only way a writer can hope to overcome them. The first obstacle is the common terminology most writers use to think about story. Terms like "rising action," "climax," "progressive complication," and "denouement," terms that go as far back as Aristotle, are so broad and theoretical as to be almost meaningless. Let's be honest: they have no practical value for storytellers. Say you are writing a scene where your hero is hanging by his fingertips, seconds from falling to his death. Is that a progressive complication, a rising action, a denouement, or the opening scene of thestory? It may be none of them or all of them, but in any event, these terms don't tell you how to write the scene or whether to write it at all.The classic story terms suggest an even bigger obstacle to good technique: the very idea of what story is and how it works. As a storyteller in training, the first thing you probably did was read Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>. I believe Aristotle was the greatest philosopher in history. But his thinking about story, while powerful, is surprisingly narrow, focused on a limited number of plots and genres. It is also extremely theoretical and difficult to put into actual practice, which is why most storytellers trying to learn the practical techniques of their craft from Aristotle leave empty-handed.If you are a screenwriter, you probably moved from Aristotle to a much simpler understanding of story called "three-act structure." This is also problematic, because three-act structure, albeit a lot easier to understand than Aristotle, is hopelessly simplistic and in many ways just plain wrong.Three-act theory says that every story for the screen has three "acts": the first act is the beginning, the second is the middle, and the third is the end. The first act is about thirty pages long. The third act is also about thirty pages long. And the second act runs to around sixty pages. And this three-act story supposedly has two or three "plot points" (whatever those are). Got that? Great. Now go and write a professional script.I'm simplifying this theory of story, but not by much. It should be obvious that such an elementary approach has even less practical value than Aristotle. But what's worse is that it promotes a view of story that is mechanical. The idea of an act break comes from the conventions of traditional theater, where we close the curtain to signal the end of an act. We don't need to do that in movies, novels, and short stories or even, for that matter, in many contemporary plays.In short, act breaks are external to the story. Three-act structure is a mechanical device superimposed on the story and has nothing to do with its internal logic--where the story should or should not go.A mechanical view of story, like three-act theory, inevitably leads to episodic storytelling. An episodic story is a collection of pieces, like parts stored in a box. Events in the story stand out as discrete elements and don't connect or build steadily from beginning to end. The result is a story that moves the audience sporadically, if at all.Another obstacle to mastering storytelling has to do with the writingprocess. Just as many writers have a mechanical view of what a story is, they use a mechanical process for creating one. This is especially true of screenwriters whose mistaken notions of what makes a script salable lead them to write a script that is neither popular nor good. Screenwriters typically come up with a story idea that is a slight variation on a movie they saw six months previously. Then they apply a genre, like "detective," "love," or "action," and fill in the characters and plot beats (story events) that go with that form. The result: a hopelessly generic, formulaic story devoid of originality.In this book, I want to show you a better way. My goal is to explain how a great story works, along with the techniques needed to create one, so that you will have the best chance of writing a great story of your own. Some would argue that it's impossible to teach someone how to tell a great story. I believe it can be done, but it requires that we think and talk about story differently than in the past.In simplest terms, I'm going to lay out a practical poetics for storytellers that works whether you're writing a screenplay, a novel, a play, a teleplay, or a short story. I will� Show that a great story is organic--not a machine but a living body that develops� Treat storytelling as an exacting craft with precise techniques that will help you be successful, regardless of the medium or genre you choose� Work through a writing process that is also organic, meaning that we will develop characters and plot that grow naturally out of your original story ideaThe main challenge facing any storyteller is overcoming the contradiction between the first and second of these tasks. You construct a story from hundreds, even thousands, of elements using a vast array of techniques. Yet the story must feel organic to the audience; it must seem like a single thing that grows and builds to a climax. If you want to become a great storyteller, you have to master this technique to such a high degree that your characters seem to be acting on their own, as <i>they</i> must, even though you are the one making them act that way.In this sense we storytellers are a lot like athletes. A great athlete makes everything look easy, as though his body just naturally moves that way. But in fact he has so mastered the techniques of his sport that his technique has simply disappeared from view, and the audience sees only beauty.THE TELLER AND THE LISTENERLet's begin the process simply, with a one-line definition of a story:A speaker tells a listener what someone did to get what he wanted and why.Notice we have three distinct elements: the teller, the listener, and the story that is told.The storyteller is first and foremost someone who <i>plays</i>. Stories are verbal games the author plays with the audience (they keep no score--the studios, networks, and publishing houses do that). The storyteller makes up characters and actions. He tells what happened, laying out a set of actions that have been completed in some way. Even if he tells the story in the present tense (as in playwriting or screenwriting), the storyteller is summing up all the events, so the listener feels that this is a single unit, the full story.But telling a story is not simply making up or remembering past events. Events are just descriptive. The storyteller is really selecting, connecting, and building a series of intense moments. These moments are so charged that the listener feels he is living them himself. Good storytelling doesn't just tell audiences what happened in a life. It gives them the experience of that life. It is the <i>essential</i> life, just the crucial thoughts and events, but it is conveyed with such freshness and newness that it feels part of the audience's essential life too.Good storytelling lets the audience relive events in the present so they can understand the forces, choices, and emotions that led the character to do what he did. Stories are really giving the audience a form of knowledge--emotional knowledge--or what used to be known as wisdom, but they do it in a playful, entertaining way.As a creator of verbal games that let the audience relive a life, the storyteller is constructing a kind of puzzle about people and asking the listener to figure it out. The author creates this puzzle in two major ways: he tells the audience certain information about a made-up character, and he <i>withholds</i> certain information. Withholding, or hiding, information is crucial to the storyteller's make-believe. It forces the audience to figure out who the character is and what he is doing and so draws the audience into the story. When the audience no longer has to figure out the story, it ceases being an audience, and the story stops.Audiences love both the feeling part (reliving the life) and the thinking part (figuring out the puzzle) of a story. Every good story has both. But you can see story forms that go to one extreme or the other, from sentimental melodrama to the most cerebral detective story.THE STORYThere have been thousands, if not millions, of stories. So what makes each of them a story? What do all stories do? What is the storyteller both revealing to and hiding from the audience?<i>KEY POINT: All stories are a form of communication that expresses the dramatic code.</i>The dramatic code, embedded deep in the human psyche, is an artistic description of how a person can grow or evolve. This code is also a process going on underneath every story. The storyteller hides this process beneath particular characters and actions. But the code of growth is what the audience ultimately takes from a good story.Let's look at the dramatic code in its simplest form.In the dramatic code, change is fueled by desire. The "story world" doesn't boil down to "I think, therefore I am" but rather "I want, therefore I am." Desire in all of its facets is what makes the world go around. It is what propels all conscious, living things and gives them direction. A story tracks what a person wants, what he'll do to get it, and what costs he'll have to pay along the way.Once a character has a desire, the story "walks" on two "legs": acting and learning. A character pursuing a desire takes actions to get what he wants, and he learns new information about better ways to get it. Whenever he learns new information, he makes a decision and changes his course of action.All stories move in this way. But some story forms highlight one of these activities over the other. The genres that highlight taking action the most are myth and its later version, the action form. The genres that highlight learning the most are the detective story and the multiperspective drama.Any character who goes after a desire and is impeded is forced to struggle (otherwise the story is over). And that struggle makes him change. So the ultimate goal of the dramatic code, and of the storyteller, is to present a change in a character or to illustrate why that change did not occur.The different forms of storytelling frame human change in differing ways:� Myth tends to show the widest character arc, from birth to death and from animal to divine.� Plays typically focus on the main character's moment of decision.� Film (especially American film) shows the small change a character might undergo by seeking a limited goal with great intensity.� Classic short stories usually track a few events that lead the character to gain a single important insight.� Serious novels typically depict how a person interacts and changes within an entire society or show the precise mental and emotional processes leading up to his change.� Television drama shows a number of characters in a minisociety struggling to change simultaneously.Drama is a code of maturity. The focal point is the moment of change, the <i>impact</i>, when a person breaks free of habits and weaknesses and ghosts from his past and transforms to a richer and fuller self. The dramatic code expresses the idea that human beings can become a better version of themselves, psychologically and morally. And that's why people love it.<i>KEY POINT: Stories don't show the audience the "real world"; they show the story world. The story world isn't a copy of life as it is. It's life as human beings imagine it</i> could <i>be. It is human life condensed and heightened so that the audience can gain a better understanding of how life itself works.</i>THE STORY BODYA great story describes human beings going through an organic process. But it is also a living body unto itself. Even the simplest children's story is made up of many parts, or subsystems, that connect with and feed off one another. Just as the human body is made up of the nervous system, the circulatory system, the skeleton, and so on, a story is made of subsystems like the characters, the plot, the revelations sequence, the story world, the moral argument, the symbol web, the scene weave, and symphonic dialogue (all of which will be explained in upcoming chapters).We might say that theme, or what I call moral argument, is the brain of the story. Character is the heart and circulation system. Revelations are the nervous system. Story structure is the skeleton. Scenes are the skin.<i>KEY POINT: Each subsystem of the story consists of a</i> web <i>of elements that help define and differentiate the other elements.</i>No individual element in your story, including the hero, will work unless you first create it and define it in relation to all the other elements.STORY MOVEMENTTo see how an organic story moves, let's look at nature. Like the storyteller, nature often connects elements in some kind of sequence. The following diagram shows a number of distinct elements that must be connected in time.Nature uses a few basic patterns (and a number of variations) to connect elements in a sequence, including linear, meandering, spiral, branching, and explosive.1 Storytellers use these same patterns, individually and in combination, to connect story events over time. The linear and explosive patterns are at the opposite extremes. The linear pattern has one thing happening after another on a straight-line path. Explosion has everything happening simultaneously. The meandering, spiral, and branching patterns are combinations of the linear and the explosive. Here's how these patterns work in stories.Linear StoryThe linear story tracks a single main character from beginning to end, like this:It implies a historical or biological explanation for what happens. Most Hollywood films are linear. They focus on a single hero who pursues a particular desire with great intensity. The audience witnesses the history of how the hero goes after his desire and is changed as a result.Meandering StoryThe meandering story follows a winding path without apparent direction. In nature, the meander is the form of rivers, snakes, and the brain:Myths like the <i>Odyssey</i>; comic journey stories like <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>Little Big Man</i>, and <i>Flirting with Disaster</i>; and many of Dickens's stories, such as <i>David Copperfield</i>, take the meandering form. The hero has a desire, but it is not intense; he covers a ...</p><h2>Bioconjugate Techniques</h2><p><b>Bioconjugate Techniques</b> is the essential guide to the modification and crosslinking of biomolecules for use in research, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

Today, science and religion are the two major cultural entities on our planet that share this goal of coherent understanding, though their interpretation of evidence differs dramatically. Many scientists look at the known universe and conclude we are here by chance. The renowned astronomer and historian of science Owen Gingerich looks at the same evidence&#x2015;along with the fact that the universe is comprehensible to our minds&#x2015;and sees it as proof for the planning and intentions of a Creator-God. He believes that the idea of a universe without God is an oxymoron, a self-contradiction. <i>God&#x2019;s Planet</i> exposes the fallacy in thinking that science and religion can be kept apart.</p><p>Gingerich frames his argument around three questions: Was Copernicus right, in dethroning Earth from its place at the center of the universe? Was Darwin right, in placing humans securely in an evolving animal kingdom? And was Hoyle right, in identifying physical constants in nature that seem singularly tuned to allow the existence of intelligent life on planet Earth? Using these episodes from the history of science, Gingerich demonstrates that cultural attitudes, including religious or antireligious beliefs, play a significant role in what passes as scientific understanding. The more rigorous science becomes over time, the more clearly God&#x2019;s handiwork can be comprehended.</p></p><p>Owen Gingerich is Professor of Astronomy and of the History of Science, Emeritus, at the Harvard&#x2013;Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.[A] short, punchy, accessible, and thought-provoking book... What sets this book apart from others dealing with the science&#x2013;religion debate is that rather than dealing in generalities, the author illustrates his viewpoint by focusing on three case studies related to the work of three scientists, Nicolaus Copernicus, Charles Darwin, and Fred Hoyle. The introduction of personal details concerning these thinkers makes what is already an easy read even more enjoyable and engaging.

The Rougon-Macquart series brought Zola literary fame and is considered his life work. It took 25 years to finish the 20 volumes. The idea of writing the social history of a family encompassing several volumes probably came from his reading the works of Balzac. Zola shows how people in a family who appear to be quite individualistic are actually quite similar. Heredity and proximity determine who we are and how we act. Theresa Raquin was first published in 1867 in serial form in L; Artiste. In 1873 Zola turned the novel into a play. In Theresa Raquin a well-intentioned aunt marries a young woman to her first cousin. Camille is sickly and selfish, and when the opportunity arises, Thrse enters into a tragic affair with Camille&#39;s friend Laurent. Zola called this novel a scientific study of temperament instead of a character study making it an example of naturalism.</p><p>&#39;Therese Raquin&#39; is a clinically observed, sinister tale of adultery and murder among the lower orders in nineteenth-century Paris. Zola&#39;s dispassionate dissection of the motivations of his characters, mere &#39;human beasts&#39; who kill in order to satisfy their lust, is much more than an atmospheric Second Empire period-piece. &#39;Therese Raquin&#39; stands as a key early manifesto of the French Naturalist movement, of which Zola was the founding father. Even today, this novel has lost none of its power to shock.?mile Zola was a French writer who is recognized as an exemplar of literary naturalism and for his contributions to the development of theatrical naturalism. Zola s best-known literary works include the twenty-volume Les Rougon-Macquart, an epic work that examined the influences of violence, alcohol and prostitution on French society through the experiences of two families, the Rougons and the Macquarts. Other remarkable works by Zola include Contes ? Ninon, Les Myst?res de Marseille, and Th?r?se Raquin.<p>In addition to his literary contributions, Zola played a key role in the Dreyfus Affair of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. His newspaper article J Accuse accused the highest levels of the French military and government of obstruction of justice and anti-semitism, for which he was convicted of libel in 1898. After a brief period of exile in England, Zola returned to France where he died in 1902. ?mile Zola is buried in the Panth?on alongside other esteemed literary figures Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas.</p></p><h2>Rethinking Women&#39;s and Gender Studies</h2><p><p><em>Rethinking Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies</em> re-examines the field&#x2019;s foundational assumptions by identifying and critically analyzing eighteen of its key terms. Each essay investigates a single term (e.g., feminism, interdisciplinarity, intersectionality) by asking how it has come to be understood and mobilized in Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies and then explicates the roles it plays in both producing and shutting down possible versions of the field. The goal of the book is to trace and expose critical paradoxes, ironies, and contradictions embedded in the language of Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies&#x2015;from its high theory to its casual conversations&#x2015;that relies on these key terms. <em>Rethinking Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies</em> offers a fresh approach to structuring Feminist Theory, Senior Capstone, and introductory graduate-level courses in Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies.</p></p><p><p></p> <p>CATHERINE M.

As a comic novel replete with bawdy humour and generous sentiments, it introduces us to a vivid group of memorable characters, variously eccentric, farcical and endearing. As an anti-novel, it is a deliberately tantalising and exuberantly egoistic work, ostentatiously digressive, involving the reader in the labyrinthine creation of a purported autobiography. This mercurial eighteenth-century text thus anticipates modernism and postmodernism. Vibrant and bizarre, Tristram Shandy provides an unforgettable experience. We may see why Nietzsche termed Sterne the most liberated spirit of all time .</p><p>Cliffs Test Preparation Guides help students prepare for and improve their performance on standardized tests ACT Preparation Guide CBEST Preparation Guide CLAST Preparation Guide ELM Review GMAT Preparation Guide GRE Preparation Guide LSAT Preparation Guide MAT Preparation Guide MATH Review for Standardized Tests MSAT Preparation Guide Memory Power for Exams Police Officer Examination Preparation Guide Police Sergeant Examination Preparation Guide Police Management Examinations Preparation Guide Postal Examinations Preparation Guide Praxis I: PPST Preparation Guide Praxis II: NTE Core Battery Preparation Guide SAT Preparation Guide SAT II Writing Preparation Guide TASP Preparation Guide TOEFL Preparation Guide with 2 cassettes Advanced Practice for the TOEFL with 2 cassettes Verbal Review for Standardized Tests Writing Proficiency Examinations You Can Pass the GED Cliffs Quick Reviews help students in introductory college courses or Advanced Placement classes Algebra I Algebra II Anatomy &amp; Physiology Basic Math and Pre-Algebra Biology Calculus Chemistry Differential Equations Economics Geometry Linear Algebra Microbiology Physics Statistics Trigonometry Cliffs Advanced Placement Preparation Guides help high school students taking Advanced Placement courses to earn college credit AP Biology AP Calculus AB AP Chemistry AP English Language &amp; Composition AP English Literature &amp; Composition AP United States History Cliffs Complete Study Editions are comprehensive study guides with complete text, running commentary and glossary Chaucer's Prologue Chaucer's Wife of Bath Hamlet Julius Caesar King Henry IV, Part I King Lear Macbeth The Merchant of Venice Othello Romeo and Juliet The Tempest Twelfth Night See inside back cover for listing of Cliffs Notes titles Registered trademarks include: GRE, MSAT, the Praxis Series, and TOEFL (Educational Testing Service): AP, Advanced Placement Program, and SAT (College Entrance Examination Board); GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Council); and LSAT (Law School Admission Council.) Tristram ShandyIntroduction and Notes by Robert Folkenflik <p>Rich in playful double entendres, digressions, formal oddities, and typographical experiments, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman provoked a literary sensation when it first appeared in England in a series of volumes from 1759 to 1767.

I would rather see it as something that wraps itself around us in everyday objects, something that is involved with day-to-day problems, with the world outside. It would be the possible itself, open to the socius, to the cosmos...&#x2015;from <i>The Machinic Unconscious: Essays in Schizoanalysis</i></p><p>In his seminal solo-authored work <i>The Machinic Unconscious</i> (originally published in French in 1979), F�lix Guattari lays the groundwork for a general pragmatics capable of resisting the semiotic enslavement of subjectivity. Concluding that psychoanalytic theory had become part and parcel of a repressive, capitalist social order, Guattari here outlines a schizoanalytic theory to undo its capitalist structure and set the discipline back on its feet. Combining theoretical research from fields as diverse as cybernetics, semiotics, ethnology, and ethology, Guattari reintroduces into psychoanalysis a &#x201c;polemical&#x201d; dimension, at once transhuman, transsexual, and transcosmic, that brings out the social and political&#x2015;the &#x201c;machinic&#x201d;&#x2015;potential of the unconscious. To illustrate his theory, Guattari turns to literature and analyzes the various modes of subjectivization and semiotization at work in Proust's <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, examining the novel as if he were undertaking a scientific exploration in the style of Freud or Newton. Casting Proust's figures as abstract (&#x201c;hyper-deterritorialized&#x201d;) mental objects, Guattari maps the separation between literature and science, elaborating along the way such major Deleuze-Guattarian concepts as &#x201c;faciality&#x201d; and &#x201c;refrain,&#x201d; which would be unpacked in their subsequent A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. Never before available in English, <i>The Machinic Unconscious</i> has for too long been the missing chapter from Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus project: the most important political extension of May 1968 and one of the most important philosophical contributions of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>F�lix Guattari (1930&#x2013;1992), post-'68 French psychoanalyst and philosopher, is the author of <i>Anti-Oedipus </i>(with Gilles Deleuze), and a number of books published by Semiotext(e), including <i>The Anti-Oedipus Papers, Chaosophy</i>, and <i>Soft Subversions.</i></p><h2>Social Skills Picture Book for High School and Beyond</h2><p><p> Winner of an iParenting Media Award! </p> <p> This picture book appeals to the visual strengths of students on the autism spectrum, with color photos of students demonstrating various social skills in the correct (and sometimes incorrect) way.

Fridell documents the accomplishments of six men over the past century, from Parisian file clerk Alphonse Bertillon's system of measuring and recording the physical characteristics of criminals to British scientist Alec Jeffreys's development of "DNA fingerprinting." In the case of each individual, it is passion and persistence, often in the face of indifference or ridicule, that made the significant achievement possible. Technical terms, italicized in the text, are defined in a glossary. Most definitions are adequate when combined with contextual clues, but some are too minimal to be useful. For instance, "blood typing" is defined as "classifying a person's blood according to its blood type." Black-and-white photos, reproductions, and diagrams enhance the presentation and occasionally show some important aspects of the techniques under discussion. An annotated list of Internet addresses and the names and addresses of eight museums and exhibits in the United States offer opportunities for continued exploration of this fascinating field.<br><i>Ann G. Brouse, Big Flats Branch Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Mystery buffs, future criminologists, curious browsers, and students scouting for a great report topic will be fascinated by Fridell's profiles of six men responsible for some of the most significant advances in the field of forensic science. In compact, surprisingly readable chapters, Fridell spans the relatively short history of the discipline, from Bertillon's complex system to describing criminals in the 1880s to Jeffrey's discovery of DNA fingerprinting in 1984. Citing cases in which each man's contribution was the determining factor in establishing identity or proving guilt or innocence, he explains how techniques such as bertillonage, fingerprinting, and blood typing evolved, and how scientists learned to examine skeletons, trace evidence, and use DNA to solve crimes. Sophisticated scientific concepts--which could easily bog down even the most interested readers--are clearly explained in the text and redefined in the glossary. Researchers will appreciate the source notes, extensive bibliography, annotated list of Web sites, and a list of museums and exhibits devoted to forensic science. <i>Chris Sherman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Lee's fascinating book. Led by Rivera, these painters used murals as a vehicle to reject the economic and political status quo and to give visible form to labor and radical ideologies, including Communism.<br><br>Several murals, and details of others, are reproduced here for the first time. Of special interest are works by Rivera that chart a progress from mural paintings commissioned for private spaces to those produced as a public act in a public space: <i>Allegory of California,</i> painted in 1930-31 at the Stock Exchange Lunch Club; <i>Making a Fresco, Showing the Building of a City</i>, done a few months later at the California School of Fine Arts; and <i>Pan American Unity</i>, painted in 1940 for the Golden Gate International Exposition.<br><br>Labor itself became a focus of the new murals: Rivera painted a massive representation of a construction worker just as San Francisco's workers were themselves organizing; Victor Arnautoff, Bernard Zakheim, John Langley Howard , and Clifford Wight painted panels in Coit Tower that acknowledged the resolve of the dockworkers striking on the streets below. Radical in technique as well, these muralists used new compositional strategies of congestion, misdirection, and fragmentation, subverting the legible narratives and coherent allegories of traditional murals.<br><br>Lee relates the development of wall painting to San Francisco's international expositions of 1915 and 1939, the new museums and art schools, corporate patronage, and the concerns of immigrants and ethnic groups. And he examines how mural painters struggled against those forces that threatened their practice: the growing acceptance of modernist easel painting, the vagaries of New Deal patronage, and a wartime nationalism hostile to radical politics.</p><p>"Anthony Lee is quickly emerging as a key figure for a whole new generation of scholars. This book on Diego Rivera is significant not only for the notable new insights it yields, but also for the disciplinary shifts that it signals. Deftly written yet replete with a density of engaged meaning that inspires critical admiration, this new look at Rivera will remain an important stimulus in the field for quite a while."&#x2015;David Craven, author of <i>Diego Rivera: As Epic Modernist</i><br><br>"This was a moment when painting mattered! In a deeply divided society, public art was a vector for contestation about what it was to be an American, a committed citizen, a moral being. With care and subtlety, and in fascinating detail, Lee shows how art, especially mural painting, became for a time the primary medium for the brokerage of power in the city of San Francisco itself. We see the murals afresh, we decipher the intense, sprawling, diversifying energies which shaped their now stilled surfaces. We might wish, these days, for a public art of similar consequence."&#x2015;Terry Smith, author of <i>Making the Modern: Industry, Art, and Design in America</i><b>Anthony W.

This book records his trips by foot, boat, and dogsled into wilderness areas north of the Arctic Circle, exploring, mountain climbing, and mapping new territories. Marshall's account, based on letters and journals written in the field, is a vivid and personal description of his adventures in remote arctic country. There were a few literate pioneers in interior Alaska, men such as Pike, Schwatka, Stefansson, and Schrader. However, most of the explorations of the territory were made by nameless Eskimos and sourdoughs whose thoughts and deeds died with them. Robert Marshall was one of the fortunate latecomers who found a great reach of arctic wilderness to explore and who left us an exceptional chronicle of his travels.<br><br>During several expeditions in Alaska in the 1930s, Marshall came upon deep canyons and primeval valleys, followed streams to their sources, and climbed great mountains of the little-explored Brooks Range. His joy was complete when, standing on some peak never before climbed, he beheld the magnificence of a wild, rugged, timeless world, filled with countless mountains and valleys previously unmapped, unnamed, and unknown.<br><br>Marshall died at the age of 38; but in his lifetime he had become a leader among those who demand a stop to the devastation of forests and insist that they be administered in the public interest, with a planned consideration of their various uses, including wilderness preservation.<br><br>In the continuing struggle over the proper uses of our natural heritage, Robert Marshall stands as an inspiration to all those who wish to preserve our remaining precious samples of original America. His matchless account of his explorations in the Central Brooks Range is all the more timely and necessary for public information now when the North Slope oil boom threatens with destruction the major part of this magnificent Alaska wilderness.</p><p>&#34;Reading this poignant volume again emphasizes to me how crucial it is to keep exploitation out of this extraordinary part of our planet, so that it can serve as a lasting beacon for America&#39;s wilderness.&#34;--Edgar Wayburn, M.D., five-time president of the Sierra Club and author of &#34;Your Land and MinePRAISE FOR THE SECOND EDITION: &#34;A book for every man and woman who loves the wilderness.

I'm Ralph Moss, author of Questioning Chemotherapy. I want to tell you how and why I came to write this book. <p>I started as a believer in chemotherapy. As a science writer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, I wrote articles praising the latest advances in chemotherapy. I was impressed by the then-emerging cures for Hodgkin's disease, acute lymphocytic leukemia and some other relatively rare cancers. At the same time, I began to learn how skeptical many good scientists were about chemotherapy's future. </p><p>The major objection to "chemo" was that these drugs did not discriminate between normal and cancerous cells, but attacked all rapidly dividing cells . One scientist described this method as "trying to melt a patient's left ear , while leaving the right one alone." It seemed particularly inappropriate in the treatment of solid tumors of adults, which are often slow-growing. </p><p>Because chemotherapy drugs were general cellular poisons, they could be terribly toxic. They were also very expensive for patients and for society as a whole. When I learned about the links between the pharmaceutical industry and the cancer establishment (later detailed in my book, The Cance r Industry) I understood the commercial reason that such an inadequate modality was so heavily promoted. </p><p>In 1989, a German biostatistician named Ulrich Abel, Ph.D. published a groundbreaking monograph called "Chemotherapy of Advanced Epithelial Cancer. It made few waves in the U.S. and soon went out of print. In this excellent work, however, Dr. Abel rigorously demonstrated that chemotherapy had never been scientifically proven to extend life through randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the vast majority of "epithelial cancers." These are the common types of carcinoma that affect most cancer patients in the Western world. </p><p>Some years later, in response to many requests, I decided to write a critical book about chemotherapy (a sort of companion piece to Cancer Therapy). I took Abel's out-of-print work as my starting point, but also consulted the work of many other students of chemotherapy. In this book, I update statistics and speak about all cancers and not just carcinomas. I go into depth on the politics and economics of the chemotherapy industry, on the biases, fallacies and frauds that occur, and on ways of warding off the sometimes catastrophic side effects that accompany this treatment. </p><p>The essential point of the book is that one must question the measure of success in chemotherapy. Oncologists have tended to equate an increasing percentage of "responses" with progress. However, responses are generally measurements of tumor shrinkage, for as little as one month's duration. One cannot automatically assume that a response--even a complete response--will lead to increased survival. One must look for increased survival. Yet the number of cancers for which life prolongation through chemotherapy has been proven through randomized clinical trials is very small. (I do bend over backwards to point these out, when they occur.) </p><p>So when a doctor says her regimen yields a 40 percent response rate, "what exactly is she promising? A short-term shrinkage of tumors--or actual life-prolongation? What effect is this treatment likely to have on the patient's quality of life? And what is the cost?" It is only by obtaining information such as this that patients are able to make rational treatment choices. Questioning Chemotherapy is intended to help patients by providing them with a critical perspective on this now dominant modality.</p></p><h2>The Ropes to Skip and the Ropes to Know: Studies in Organizational Theory and Behavior</h2><p>Now in its eighth edition, <i>The Ropes</i> has been used by business professionals for over thirty years.

Spiritual baths promote health and have been proven to aid in the treatment of anxiety, grief, insomnia, and depression. In SPIRITUAL BATHING, best-selling authors Rosita Arvigo and Nadine Epstein explore this lost art and its fascinating history, with information on where sacred baths are currently offered and easy recipes to create bathing rituals in your home. Derived from various regions and philosophies&#x2014;Shinto, Buddhist, Wiccan, Mayan, and others&#x2014;most of these baths require only water, a simple ritual, accessible plants and herbs, and the desire to nurture your spirit.

She resides in San Ignacio, Cayo, Belize.<br>NADINE EPSTEIN is a writer and artist whose articles have appeared in the <i>New York Times, Smithsonian,</i> and <i>Ms.</i> She lives in Washington, D.C.Arvigo and Epstein, authors of a previous book on contemporary uses of the Mayan tradition, offer an intriguing historical-cum-spiritual tour of world religious traditions involving water, its ritual use and spiritual significance. The authors rightly note that water has played an essential role in the rise of world cultures throughout history, and it has been assigned spiritual meaning within various cultures' belief systems. They review 15 cultures' selected beliefs and rituals, some more successfully than others. A tilt toward pre-Columbian Mesoamerican spiritual traditions separate chapters are devoted to the Mayans, Aztecs and Incas is arbitrary but understandable, given the authors' previous book and training with a Mayan shaman. But it does result in relatively stinted treatment of sacred water rituals within such dominant religious traditions as Christianity, in which baptism is one of the world's best-known water initiation rituals, and Hinduism, which has been shaped by the spiritual significance of India's river waters. Practical applications in home ritual are commendable but sometimes strained. While flower baths can be easily done at home without special accessories, a bather will need a fairly large garden for regular baths and, for ideal infusion, sunny conditions more frequent in Belize author Arvigo's home than in, say, Seattle. Still, the book shines light on a common element and underappreciated aspect of ritual that flows through different epochs and world cultures, and its more than 100 color photos greatly enhance the text. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this authoritative study, Thomas E. Skidmore, one of America's leading experts on Latin America and, in particular, on Brazil, offers the first analysis of more than two decades of military rule, from the overthrow of Jo�o Goulart in 1964, to the return of democratic civilian government in 1985 with the presidency of Jos� Sarney. <br> A sequel to Skidmore's highly acclaimed <em>Politics in Brazil, 1930-1964</em>, this volume explores the military rule in depth. Why did the military depose Goulart? What kind of "economic miracle" did their technocrats fashion? Why did General Costa e Silva's attempts to "humanize the Revolution" fail, only to be followed by the most repressive regime of the period? What led Generals Geisel and Golbery to launch the liberalization that led to <em>abertura</em>? What role did the Brazilian Catholic Church, the most innovative in the Americas, play? How did the military government respond in the early 1980s to galloping inflation and an unpayable foreign debt? <br> Skidmore concludes by examining the early Sarney presidency and the clues it may offer for the future. Will democratic governments be able to meet the demands of urban workers and landless peasants while maintaining economic growth and international competitiveness? Can Brazil at the same time control inflation and service the largest debt in the developing world? Will its political institutions be able to represent effectively an electorate now three times larger than in 1964? What role will the military play in the future? <br> In recent years, many Third World nations--Argentina, the Philippines, and Uruguay, among others--have moved from repressive military regimes to democratic civilian governments. Skidmore's study provides insight into the nature of this transition in Brazil and what it may tell about the fate of democracy in the Third World.<br></p><p>This sequel to Skidmore&#39;s highly acclaimed Politics in Brazil, 1930-1964 offers the first analysis of more than two decades of military rule in the largest and most influential country in Latin America, from the overthrow of Joao Goulart in 1964, to the return of democratic civilian government in 1985 with the presidency of Jose Sarney.<br><strong>Thomas E.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.<p><b>Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell</b> was born in London in 1810, but she spent her formative years in Cheshire, Stratford-upon-Avon and the north of England. In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell, who became well known as the minister of the Unitarian Chapel in Manchester&#x2019;s Cross Street. As well as leading a busy domestic life as minister&#x2019;s wife and mother of four daughters, she worked among the poor, traveled frequently and wrote. <b>Mary Barton</b> (1848) was her first success.</p> <p>Two years later she began writing for Dickens&#x2019;s magazine, <b>Household Words</b>, to which she contributed fiction for the next thirteen years, notably a further industrial novel, <b>North and South</b> (1855). In 1850 she met and secured the friendship of Charlotte Bront�. After Charlotte&#x2019;s death in March 1855, Patrick Bront� chose his daughter&#x2019;s friend and fellow-novelist to write The <b>Life of Charlotte Bront�</b> (1857), a probing and sympathetic account, that has attained classic stature. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s position as a clergyman&#x2019;s wife and as a successful writer introduced her to a wide circle of friends, both from the professional world of Manchester and from the larger literary world. Her output was substantial and completely professional. Dickens discovered her resilient strength of character when trying to impose his views on her as editor of <b>Household Words</b>. She proved that she was not to be bullied, even by such a strong-willed man.</p> <p>Her later works, <b>Sylvia&#x2019;s Lovers</b> (1863), <b>Cousin Phillis</b> (1864) and <b>Wives and Daughters</b> (1866) reveal that she was continuing to develop her writing in new literary directions. Elizabeth Gaskell died suddenly in November 1865.</p></p><h2>Prayer Life</h2><p>"Prayer is the very pulse of the spiritual life." So Andrew Murray reminds us in this classic book on the power of prayer. With profound insight, the author reveals the greatest secret to success in our pursuit of God, that in spiritual work everything depends upon prayer. Most often it is simply the sin of prayerlessness that causes us to fall short in reaching our full potential in God.<br> <br> Prayer flows out of a renewed relationship with Christ, a communion with God based upon love and trust in Him to be our all&#x2013;sufficiency. It is only this life of persevering and believing prayer that leads to a powerful and abundant spiritual walk in Christ.<br></p><p>South African pastor and author Andrew Murray (1828 1917) was an amazingly prolific writer. Murray began writing on the Christian life for his congregation as an extension of his local pastoral work, but he became internationally known for his books, such as <i>With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> and <i>Abide in Christ</i>, that searched men's hearts and brought them into a deep relationship with Christ. Writing with an intensity of purpose and zeal for the message of the gospel, Murray wrote numerous books even after his "retirement" at age seventy&#x2013;eight.Text: English, Afrikaans (translation)</p><h2>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Encyclopedia of Literature</h2><p>&#34;A rich source of information about the world&#39;s finest literature. Over 10,000 entries and 250 illustrations covering authors, works, and literary terms and topics from all eras and all parts of the world. Includes pronunciations.&#34;</p><p><p>For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America's leading and most-trusted provider of language information. All Merriam-Webster products and services are backed by the largest team of professional dictionary editors and writers in America, and one of the largest in the world.</p>A joint effort of editorial staffs from Merriam-Webster and Encyclopaedia Britannica, <i>Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature</i> (<i>MWEL</i>) "contains entries for authors, works, literary landmarks, literary and critical terms, mythological and folkloric figures, fictional characters, literary movements and prizes, and other miscellaneous matters." The book is encyclopedic in coverage but very dictionary-like in its brevity of entries.<p>The more than 10,000 entries in this volume cover a vast amount of territory. There are biographical entries covering all nationalities and periods (<i>Cavalcanti, Guido</i>; <i>Futabatei, Shimei</i>; <i>Joyce, James</i>), brief entries on literary characters (<i>Bovary, Emma</i>; <i>Hawkins, Jim</i>), on specific works (<i>Driving Miss Daisy</i>; <i>Lotus-Eaters, The</i>), on forms of criticism (<i>Feminist Criticism</i>, <i>New Criticism</i>), on movements and events (<i>Jindyworobak Movement</i>, <i>War of the Theaters</i>), and on styles (<i>Eclogue</i>, <i>Guwen</i>). The only thing lacking is entries on the literary traditions of specific countries.</p><p>The average entry is well under 150 words, with the longest under 700 (<i>Shakespeare, William</i>, for example), and some as few as seven (<i>Lineation</i> is defined simply as "an arrangement of lines [as of verse]" ). Pronunciation is provided for most entries (even <i>Miller, Daisy</i> has one) and then an etymology for entries that define terminology. For biographical entries, places and dates of birth and death are given. The entry proper includes any cross-references ("used sparingly" according to the prefatory material) in small-capital letters. Titles of works are given in the original language followed by English translation. All entries are unsigned, and there are no bibliographies. Several hundred small black-and-white photographs and illustrations are provided.</p><p>By attempting to cover almost everything, some entries are almost uselessly brief (as in the <i>Lineation</i> example above). Others, though with a literary connection, almost seem lifted from a Merriam-Webster dictionary. <i>Epigraph</i>, for example, has two definitions, the first being "an inscription on a statue, a building, or a coin," and the second, "a quotation set at the beginning of a literary work." An oddity is the inconsistent description of living writers in both the present and past tense. The entry <i>Drabble, Margaret</i>, for example begins, "English writer of novels that are skillfully modulated variations on the theme of. . . ." <i>Proulx, E. Annie</i>, however, begins, "American writer whose darkly comic yet sad fiction was peopled with quirky, memorable characters." Nevertheless, <i>MWEL</i> admirably covers topics from a wide breadth of literary subjects. The volume also will serve as a valuable supplementary source for literary allusions, with such entries as <i>Banshee</i>, <i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Kali</i>, and a variety of other mythological and religious entries.</p><p><i>MWEL</i> perhaps most closely represents the various Oxford Companion titles for depth of coverage, though even in that series one must first find the appropriate country-or genre-related volume. Any number of literary dictionaries and biographical dictionaries contain similar entries, but for sheer ready-reference capabilities, <i>MWEL</i> is in a class of its own. Its low price further justifies a place for this volume on any library's reference shelf. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Young Reader&#39;s Shakespeare: Othello</h2><p><b>A new entry in the superb, visually striking, and innovative series for young people.

The photographs are printed as tritones, to capture their delicacy and detail, and are preceded by an introduction that describes Leivick&#x2019;s goals and experiences as a photographer working at Carrara and provides a brief outline of the region&#x2019;s geology and long history of marble extraction. In an Afterword, anthropologist Alison Leitch discusses the culture of quarry work and the role of landscape in historical memory.<br><br>The photographs of the Carrara quarries lay bare a vast and dramatic landscape as imposing as the Grand Canyon, reaching down from the mountains like a carefully orchestrated disaster of immense and inhuman size. But this vastness, hardly picturesque, is the result of steady attrition at the hands of man, a canyon carved by centuries of labor and ambition. With its overwhelming mass, Carrara is the scene for a primordial revealing of elements. In Leivick&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;At every turn the human as well as the geologic record is exposed. The noble outcroppings of stone and the most mundane debris&#x2014;layers of a complex history&#x2014;were set before me, defined by brilliant, revelatory light.

Until now, those failures have been attributed largely to individual mistakes. But Zegart shows how and why the intelligence system itself left us vulnerable.</p><br><p> Zegart argues that after the Cold War ended, the CIA and FBI failed to adapt to the rise of terrorism. She makes the case by conducting painstaking analysis of more than three hundred intelligence reform recommendations and tracing the history of CIA and FBI counterterrorism efforts from 1991 to 2001, drawing extensively from declassified government documents and interviews with more than seventy high-ranking government officials. She finds that political leaders were well aware of the emerging terrorist danger and the urgent need for intelligence reform, but failed to achieve the changes they sought. The same forces that have stymied intelligence reform for decades are to blame: resistance inside U.S. intelligence agencies, the rational interests of politicians and career bureaucrats, and core aspects of our democracy such as the fragmented structure of the federal government. Ultimately failures of adaptation led to failures of performance. Zegart reveals how longstanding organizational weaknesses left unaddressed during the 1990s prevented the CIA and FBI from capitalizing on twenty-three opportunities to disrupt the September 11 plot.</p><br><br><p> <i>Spying Blind</i> is a sobering account of why two of America's most important intelligence agencies failed to adjust to new threats after the Cold War, and why they are unlikely to adapt in the future.</p></p><p><p>"There is no longer any doubt of the failure of our intelligence agencies in the years following the Cold War. Amy Zegart has examined the reasons for this failure in addition to the well-meaning but mistaken attempts to address the problem. An important book for all those interested in the nation's security."<b>--Thomas H. Kean, chairman of the 9/11 Commission and former governor of New Jersey</b></p><p>"<i>Spying Blind</i> is a timely and sweeping overview of the organizational challenges confronting our intelligence agencies in an age of terrorism. Amy Zegart has written a comprehensive and engaging book that will be of interest to anyone who seeks a better understanding of America's national-security agencies."<b>--Lee Hamilton, president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</b></p><p>"Amy Zegart has written a pathbreaking book--picking a path through the rubble of countless reform commissions, congressional committees, and expert reports on how to adapt U.S. intelligence infrastructure to a post-Cold War, post-9/11 world. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with the theory or practice of national security in the twenty-first century."<b>--Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University</b></p><p>"Amy Zegart believes, quite rightly, that even six years after the terrorist attacks the government of the United States continues to be plagued by deep-seated institutional deficiencies within the community of intelligence agencies. This outstanding book, clearly written and exhaustively researched, stands as a major contribution to our understanding of why this is the case, and what can be done about it."<b>--Loch K. Johnson, University of Georgia</b></p><p>"<i>Spying Blind</i> is both a clarion call for organizational reform of the intelligence community and a sober warning that effective reforms will not be forthcoming unless Congress also changes the way it manages our intelligence agencies."<b>--Scott D. Sagan, Stanford University</b></p><p>"An outstanding demonstration of how the adaptation failures of the CIA and FBI before and after 9/11 lie in deep-rooted organizational deficiencies and not individuals asleep at the switch."<b>--Graham Allison, Harvard University</b></p><p> "Professor Zegart's work is breathtaking in scope and revolutionary. This is the first effort to put the CIA and other intelligence agencies under the microscope of social science."<b>--Gary Hart, former senator and chairman of the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st Century</b></p><p>"This is an excellent book. The writing is gracious and many of the turns of phrase are both eye-catching and very satisfying. The documentation is extensive but straightforward and not cumbersome. The book moves along briskly--a good read. This is not common in the political-science literature and certainly not with a subject matter such as intelligence."<b>--Charles Perrow, author of <i>The Next Catastrophe</i></b></p><p>"The book's central argument is that the U.S. intelligence agencies did not adapt to the changed world after the cold war and have not shown much sign of adapting even after 9/11. While most academics hedge in language, Zegart's is straightforward. The writing is very clean and readable. The book rests on a lot of research."<b>--Gregory F.

Overcrowding in these areas led to packed urban graveyards that were not only unsightly, but were also a source of public health fears. The solution was a revolutionary new type of American burial ground located in the countryside just beyond the city. This rural cemetery movement, which featured beautifully landscaped grounds and sculptural monuments, is documented by James R. Cothran and Erica Danylchak in Grave Landscapes: The Nineteenth-Century Rural Cemetery Movement.<br><br>The movement began in Boston, where a group of reformers that included members of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society were grappling with the city's mounting burial crisis. Inspired by the naturalistic garden style and melancholy-infused commemorative landscapes that had emerged in Europe, the group established a burial ground outside of Boston on an expansive tract of undulating, wooded land and added meandering roadways, picturesque ponds, ornamental trees and shrubs, and consoling memorials. They named it Mount Auburn and officially dedicated it as a rural cemetery.<br><br>This groundbreaking endeavor set a powerful precedent that prompted the creation of similarly landscaped rural cemeteries outside of growing cities first in the Northeast, then in the Midwest and South, and later in the West. These burial landscapes became a cultural phenomenon attracting not only mourners seeking solace, but also urbanites seeking relief from the frenetic confines of the city. Rural cemeteries predated America's public parks, and their popularity as picturesque retreats helped propel America's public parks movement.<br><br>This beautifully illustrated volume features more than 150 historic photographs, stereographs, postcards, engravings, maps, and contemporary images that illuminate the inspiration for rural cemeteries, their physical evolution, and the nature of the landscapes they inspired. Extended profiles of twenty-four rural cemeteries reveal the cursive design features of this distinctive landscape type prior to the American Civil War and its evolution afterward. Grave Landscapes details rural cemetery design characteristics to facilitate their identification and preservation and places rural cemeteries into the broader context of American landscape design to encourage appreciation of their broader influence on the design of public spaces.</p><p>James R Cothran (1940-2012) was a landscape architect, urban planner, and garden historian in Atlanta, Georgia, where he served as an adjunct professor of garden history and preservation at the University of Georgia and Georgia State University.

We learn the clothes villagers wore, their (sometimes lacking) standards of personal hygiene, and the bizarre treatments they devised for a variety of medical maladies. But it wasn&#x2019;t all bad: the medieval village was one of the first functional modern societies, and its surprisingly advanced legal system and code of conduct helped lay the groundwork for contemporary civilization.</p>Though the main focus is on Elton, circa 1300, the Gieses supply general historical context for the origin, development, and decline of the European village.

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With <i>The Corrections</i>, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.</p><p>Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.</p><p>Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a "transgressive" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.</p><p>Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.</p></p><p>Jonathan Franzen's exhilarating novel <i>The Corrections</i> tells a spellbinding story with sexy comic brio, and evokes a quirky family akin to Anne Tyler's, only bitter. Franzen's great at describing Christmas homecomings gone awry, cruise-ship follies, self-deluded academics, breast-obsessed screenwriters, stodgy old farts and edgy Tribeca bohemians equally at sea in their lives, and the mad, bad, dangerous worlds of the Internet boom and the fissioning post-Soviet East. <p> All five members of the Lambert family get their due, as everybody's lives swirl out of control. Paterfamilias Alfred is slipping into dementia, even as one of his inventions inspires a pharmaceutical giant to revolutionize treatment of his disease. His stubborn wife, Enid, specializes in denial; so do their kids, each in an idiosyncratic way. Their hepcat son, Chip, lost a college sinecure by seducing a student, and his new career as a screenwriter is in peril. Chip's sister, Denise, is a chic chef perpetually in hot water, romantically speaking; banker brother Gary wonders if his stifling marriage is driving him nuts. We inhabit these troubled minds in turn, sinking into sorrow punctuated by laughter, reveling in Franzen's satirical eye: </p><blockquote> Gary in recent years had observed, with plate tectonically cumulative anxiety, that population was continuing to flow out of the Midwest and toward the cooler coasts.... Gary wished that all further migration [could] be banned and all Midwesterners encouraged to revert to eating pasty foods and wearing dowdy clothes and playing board games, in order that a strategic national reserve of cluelessness might be maintained, a wilderness of taste which would enable people of privilege, like himself, to feel extremely civilized in perpetuity. </blockquote> Franzen is funny and on the money.

It begins by exploring the nature and meaning of that all-too-difficult word spirituality and then leads readers through the entire Bible--from Genesis to Revelation--to develop a biblical spirituality that can serve as a guiding light in this age of spiritual seeking. Informed by the latest scholarship, this book makes the Bible more intelligible and &#39;user friendly&#39; for contemporary audiences by stressing the spiritual dimension of the search for God evident in our biblical ancestors and showing how the Bible can be a friend and companion in our search for God today. It illustrates the continuity of the Old and New Testaments and the progression of faith and insight about God--the turns and dead-ends, the mistakes and successes, the struggles and challenges--that reflect in some way our own contemporary experience and search for God. By showing readers that the biblical authors were real people who struggled with life&#39;s puzzles and challenges in the same way that we do, Biblical Foundations of Spirituality reveals the rich treasure of spiritual wisdom that the Bible contains and connects the wisdom and witness of Scripture with everyday life and spirituality. Complete with a historical chronology, reflection questions, a glossary, and extensive notes and bibliography, this book is ideal for classroom and parish use as well as for individual readers.</p><p>Barbara E.

And his artistic vision remains palpably present today, through the countless statues, fountains, and buildings that transformed Rome into the Baroque theater that continues to enthrall tourists today.It is perhaps not surprising that this artist who defined the Baroque should have a personal life that itself was, well, baroque. As Franco Mormando&#x2019;s dazzling biography reveals, Bernini was a man driven by many passions, possessed of an explosive temper and a hearty sex drive, and he lived a life as dramatic as any of his creations. Drawing on archival sources, letters, diaries, and&#x2014;with a suitable skepticism&#x2014;a hagiographic account written by Bernini&#x2019;s son (who portrays his father as a paragon of virtue and piety), Mormando leads us through Bernini&#x2019;s many feuds and love affairs, scandals and sins. He sets Bernini&#x2019;s raucous life against a vivid backdrop of Baroque Rome, bustling and wealthy, and peopled by churchmen and bureaucrats, popes and politicians, schemes and secrets.The result is a seductively readable biography, stuffed with stories and teeming with life&#x2014;as wild and unforgettable as Bernini&#x2019;s art. No one who has been bewitched by the Baroque should miss it.<br></p><p><b>Franco Mormando</b> is associate professor of Italian at Boston College and the author of several books.<br><p>"By adopting the manner of a lecturer&#x2014;teasingly mentioning things to come, employing the first-person plural as a teacher, roping students into his intellectual questing, throwing in some slang now and then, and without neglecting scholarship (this is a history of papal Rome as much as a biography)&#x2014;Mormando gives us a succulent reading experience. <i>Quanto e dolce</i>."</p> (Booklist <i>starred review</i>)<br><br><p>"Mormando provides enough salacious details of the scandal-ridden life of baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini to keep readers turning pages in this engaging, well-researched biography. . . .&nbsp; Mormando&#x2019;s extensive research and documentation not only will satisfy scholars and students of art history, especially baroque aficionados, but this biography will also appeal to general readers"</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Gian Lorenzo Bernini was one artist whose life was every bit as dramatic, sensual, and emotional as his art.&nbsp;Franco Mormando's sympathetic, intimate biography moves as fast as its hyperactive subject, taking us on a whirlwind ride through the glittering courts of papal Rome and the Paris of the Sun King, Louis XIV.&nbsp;From its shocking beginning to its perfect ending, the book is sheer unmitigated delight." (Ingrid Rowland, author of Giordano Bruno)<br><br><p>"There are a few artists to whom the label 'faultless' applies, and the top of that list is Bernini, architect, showman and sculptor. Franco Mormando's book shows him in full as a man for the first time, and he is as pleasing, as sweet, as interestingly ambiguous as his amazing oeuvre. This is a wonderful book to have at last."</p> (John Crowley, author of Aegypt and Little, Big)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Franco Mormando&#x2019;s fascinating book is a welcome addition to the Bernini literature. It is both a biography of the artist and a portrait of Roman Baroque culture. Though written for a general audience, it reveals an impressive command of the specialist scholarship&#x2014;in art history, literature, and history. Mormando wears his learning lightly, writing with animation, carefully pacing his anecdotes, and making the whole as entertaining as it is informative.&#x201d;</p> (Pamela Jones, University of Massachusetts, Boston)<br><br><p>"Such a publishing landmark by a lauded historian of the period is an event."</p> (<i>The&nbsp;Tablet (UK)</i>)<br><br>"Like the finely crafted artwork, Franco Mormando's biography of Bernini is outstanding."

Focusing on the politics of war memory and commemoration, this book retheorizes the connections among history, memory, and power and refashions the fields of American studies, Asian American studies, and refugee studies not around the narratives of American exceptionalism, immigration, and transnationalism but around the crucial issues of war, race, and violence&#x2015;and the history and memories that are forged in the aftermath of war. At the same time, the book moves decisively away from the &#x201c;damage-centered&#x201d; approach that pathologizes loss and trauma by detailing how first- and second-generation Vietnamese have created alternative memories and epistemologies that challenge the established public narratives of the Vietnam War and Vietnamese people. Explicitly interdisciplinary, <i>Body Counts</i> moves between the humanities and social sciences, drawing on historical, ethnographic, cultural, and virtual evidence in order to illuminate the places where Vietnamese refugees have managed to conjure up social, public, and collective remembering.</p><p>"Eloquent, evocative, and urgent, Espiritu's Body Counts constantly hits the mark with regard to recalibrating and redirecting the dominant narrative about refugees as traumatized subjects. Espiritu focuses instead on the ways in which a close analysis of these bodies are integral to understanding the past, present, and future of U.S. imperialism and militarism."&#x2015;Cathy J. Schlund-Vials, author of <i>War, Genocide, and Justice: Cambodian American Memory Work</i><br><br> "Espiritu uses her considerable scholarly talent to develop the notion of refuge(ee) not as a social problem but as a conceptual prism that exposes the multiple legacies of U.S. militarized violence and colonialism. Original and trenchantly argued, this book refracts light on the invisible stories of Vietnamese refugees and points us towards new innovative approaches for future inquiries."&#x2015;Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, author of&nbsp;<i>Paradise Transplanted: Migration and the Making of California Gardens</i><br><br> "A pathbreaking work in &#x201c;critical refuge(e) studies,&#x201d; <i>Body Counts</i> introduces extremely rich and provocative new methodologies for investigating the humanitarian violence of U.S. military empire.

During his brief, but productive reign as &#34;enfant terrible&#34; and prodigious deity, Basquiat impacted contemporary art with an unsettling mixture of artistic resources and a personal mastery of the social nuances of his era. Collaborator with other artists such as Andy Warhol and Francesco Clemente and an influence on their work, Basquiat remains today a controversial artist of significance and excitement. The drawings in this book, published to coincide with The Whitney Museum of American Art&#39;s major retrospective of Basquiat&#39;s painting, capture all the energy, excess and conflict of the 1980s. An essential link between his street art and his painting, Basquiat&#39;s drawings provide insight into his artistic imagination and explore the entire range of his diverse interests.</p><p></p><h2>The Rainbow (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Lionel Kelly, University of Reading In 1915, Lawrence&#39;s frank representation of sexuality in The Rainbow caused a furore and the novel was seized by the police and banned almost as soon as it was published. Today it is recognised as one of the classic English novels of the twentieth century. The Rainbow is about three generations of the Brangwen family of Nottinghamshire from the 1840s to the early years of the twentieth century. Within this framework Lawrence s essential concern is with the passional lives of his characters as he explores the pressures that determine their lives, using a religious symbolism in which the rainbow of the title is his unifying motif. His primary focus is on the individual&#39;s struggle to growth and fulfilment within marriage and changing social circumstances, a process shown to grow more difficult through the generations. Young Ursula Brangwen, whose story is continued in Women in Love, is finally the central figure in Lawrence&#39;s anatomy of the confining structures of English social life and the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the human psyche.</p><p>D. H. Lawrence started &#39;The Sisters&#39; in 1913, wrote four different versions and claimed to have discarded &#39;quite a thousand pages&#39; before completing The Rainbow in 1915. Mark Kinkead-Weekes gives the composition history and collates the surviving states of the text to assess the damage done to Lawrence&#39;s great novel.Pronounced obscene when it was first published in 1915,&#34; The Rainbow is the epic story of three generations of the Brangwens, a Midlands family. A visionary novel, considered to be one of Lawrence&#39;s finest, it explores the complex sexual and psychological relationships between men and women in an increasingly industrialized world. &#34;Lives are separate, but life is continuous--it continues in the fresh start by the separate life in each generation,&#34; wrote F. R. Leavis. &#34;No work, I think, has presented this perception as an imaginatively realized truth more compellingly than &#34;The Rainbow.&#34;</p><h2>Body, Mind, and Sport: The Mind/Body Guide to Lifelong Fitness and Your Personal Best</h2><p>One of America&#39;s foremost proponents of the mind/body path to fitness makes a compelling case for his gain-without-pain approach to athletic excellence, and presents individually tailored programs for both the weekend enthusiast and the serious competitor.</p><p>John Douillard, author of <b>The 3-Season Diet </b>(Three Rivers Press), is a former professional athlete. He currently works as a consultant to the New Jersey Nets and cohosts a top-rated radio talk show in Colorado called "Health Time." He lives in Boulder, Colorado, with his wife and five children, where he practices Ayurvedic and chiropractic sports medicine.1<br><br><b>Living in the Zone</b><br><br>Pele, the great soccer player whose spectacular performance almost single-handedly inspired American awareness and appreciation of his sport, wrote of his experience of the Zone in his autobiography, My Life and Beautiful Game. "In the middle of a match, I felt a strange calmness I hadn't experienced before. It was a type of euphoria. I felt I could run all day without tiring, that I could dribble through any or all of their team, that I could almost pass through them physically. It was a strange feeling and one that I had not had before. Perhaps it was merely confidence, but I have felt confident many times without that strange feeling of invincibility."<br><br>Baseball players are famous for their exotic pregame rituals in hopes of entering the Zone, in hopes of seeing baseballs as big as watermelons floating to the plate. Superstitions such as wearing dirty socks or garter belts for weeks on end are not unusual. Former Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs was famous for his pregame chicken dinners. Almost all professional athletes, in their own ways, search for the effortless performance of the Zone.<br><br>It has been called many things. Researchers speak of it as "peak experience" or the "flow state"; they say it is an "altered state" of human consciousness that cannot be intentionally created. Athletes find it difficult to describe when they return from it, although they may attribute it to supernatural concentration, religious mysticism, Zen, visualization, or biorhythms. More commonly, athletes refer to the Zone as the "exercise high," the "runner's high," the "groove," being "unconscious," or being "locked in."<br><br>Byron Scott, of the Los Angeles Lakers, said that when he finds himself in the Zone, "All you can hear is this little voice inside you, telling you 'Shoot' every time you touch the ball, because you know it's going in. Nobody outside can penetrate this world and the person guarding you wishes he wasn't. . . . I could shoot blindfolded from half court over my head and it would go in."<br><br>Joseph Campbell, considered the world's foremost authority on mythology, was interviewed for a PBS series shortly before his death in 1987, when he was in his eighties. During the interview, Bill Moyers asked him, "How do you explain what the psychologist Maslow called 'peak experiences'?" After a pause, Campbell replied, "My own peak experiences, the ones I knew were peak experiences after I had them, all came in athletics."<br><br>The field of sports psychology, which was developed in part to help athletes reproduce the highly coveted experience of the Zone, has failed in its attempts. Dr. Keith Henschen of the University of Utah, who specializes in the field, recognizes the elusive nature and apparently unreproducible experience of the Zone, but at the same time he believes it can be randomly accessed by anyone. That is, it can come to anyone, but it comes when it comes, not necessarily when you want it to. Perhaps the most certain limiting factor, according to Henschen, is that "the harder you try to get there, the less likely it is that you will."<br><br>This generates an interesting paradox. Modern exercise theory revolves around one central pivot, the stress-and-recover cycle, which boils down to this: We must repeatedly push ourselves to our limits and then let the body recover; that is how we become stronger, faster, and so on. The Zone is defined antithetically: The harder you try to reach that state, the less likely it is that you will. Conventional training demands that we put out tremendous effort; the Zone is an experience of absolute effortlessness.<br><br>Before 1954, the 4-minute mile was considered beyond human capability. Then Roger Bannister, an English medical student, cracked the barrier, running a mile in 3:59:4. Bannister said, "We seemed to be going so slowly. . . . I was relaxing so much that my mind seemed almost detached from my body. There was no strain. There was no pain. Only a great unity of movement and aim. The world seemed to stand still or even not exist."<br><br>Bannister's experience was not "No pain, no gain," but rather, "No strain, no pain = historic world record." Although Bannister told the world his formula for success, during the nearly fifty years since his achievement, athletes have continued to train using the stress-and-recover method.<br><br>If we want to reproduce the Zone, doesn't it make more sense that we should reproduce its qualities? If the experience is effortless, then we should cultivate effortlessness, rather than push the body to its limits. It seems na�ve and foolish to expect the light, comfortable, euphoric feeling of the Zone to come with any regularity after the mind has driven the body into exhaustion.<br><br>This is one of the strategies you will learn in this book: capture the ease of the Zone from the first step of each workout, and gracefully build on that experience without dis-integrating the mind from the body.<br><br><b>Do Less and Accomplish More</b><br><br>Warren Wechsler had never considered himself an athlete. He had spent most of his adult life developing his mind, while paying little attention to his body. A successful businessman at 33, Warren suddenly found himself with a burning desire to run and set himself the goal of running a marathon by age 40.<br><br>He had a long way to go. He was overweight, stressed from his job, and completely out of shape. But he bought a pair of top-quality running shoes and started jogging. Very quickly he realized that he felt happier and healthier than before and that he had a natural talent for the sport.<br><br>After four months of pounding the pavement, Warren developed Achilles tendonitis. To alleviate it, he stretched more, went for physical therapy, and took more rest days, but the tightness on long runs persisted. He decided to "run through it"--a common technique among die-hard runners--hoping that the pain would disappear. After four more months Warren's ankle pain worsened. It soon developed into calf pain as well, then worked its way up to the knee. Undaunted, Warren continued his workouts, convinced that "all good things have their price." The aches and pains soon appeared in the other knee. When they reached his back, he was forced to hang up his running shoes.<br><br>Three years later, in 1989, Warren attended my Body, Mind, and Sport seminar. He wanted to get back to running, but, afraid of reinjury, he didn't let himself get his hopes up too high. On hearing the principle that "less is more," and that running, if done properly, should remove strain rather than produce it, Warren decided to give it another go. He began exercising again, cautiously this time, following the specific advice for his body type and listening carefully to the needs of his body. (Body types are fully explained in chapter 4.)<br><br>Warren was so conditioned to expect strain and pain that he found it strange not to hurt during his workouts. At first he noticed that his heart rate would jump from 75 BPM (beats per minute) to 170 or 180 as soon as he started exercising with even moderate exertion. After three months of reconditioning his body to do less and accomplish more on his exercise bike, he found that he could pedal for over an hour with his heart rate around 120 and his breath rate even and comfortable at around 15 breaths per minute.<br><br>In January 1990, Warren felt ready to run and rejoined his health club, which featured an indoor track. At first, finding himself lapped by his old running partners, he had to struggle against his desire to keep up with them. Listening carefully to his body--not to the ambitions of his mind or to his sense of pride--he let them pass him. Gradually he picked up speed. Soon he surpassed his former running partners, only this time he did so without injury or pain.<br><br>He called me at my office eighteen months after starting the Invincible Athletics program and gave me this report:<br><br>John, I'm 38 years old. I've never been an athlete in my life. I took your course to give my running one last try. Since then, I've lost 30 pounds and 6 inches of girth without trying or dieting. I don't get sick or anxious anymore, and I've got more vitality than I've ever known.<br><br>Yesterday, running on my indoor track, I ran 17 miles. I felt absolutely fantastic the whole way. I felt as good when I stopped as I did when I started. The amazing thing was that I ran a 6-minute-mile pace for the entire 17 miles. It was unbelievable. I was in the Zone. I felt like I was running on air. It was the easiest thing I've ever done.<br><br>The most incredible thing was that my heart rate averaged about 120 BPM during the entire run. Sometimes it went even lower, but it never went over 130 BPM while I maintained the 6-minute pace. When I counted my breath rate, it was between 12 and 15 breaths per minute. [The average breath rate at rest is 18 breaths per minute.] At this rate, when I'm 40 I could be running marathons with the best runners in the world, having the runner's high experience the entire time.<br><br>For Warren, exercise had become a means of removing stress. The more he ran, the more rejuvenated he felt.<br><br>We had been working with many athletes at our health center and finding some dramatic decreases in exertion during high-level exercise using our techniques, but a heart rate of 120 BPM while maintaining a 6-minute-mile pace was hard to believe. I figured that perhaps Warren's monitoring equipment wasn't first-rate and invited him to our health center to verify his findings.<br><br>When he came, I put him on the treadmill. It wasn't long before he had the equipment "maxed out" at 10.5 miles per hours (a little better than a 6-minute mile), and, sure enough, his heart rate was stable at about 125 BPM and he was breathing easily at just the rate he had reported. The average runner would have to strain pretty hard to run a 6-minute mile, showing hea...</p><h2>THIS REAL NIGHT (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>The second installment of West&#39;s Saga of the Century trilogy-now available as an ebook In the sequel to The Fountain Overflows, Rose Aubrey, her sisters, and her cousin stand on the brink of adulthood and a new era for women They have put down their schoolbooks and put up their hair, but a talented musician and her kin ponder what being a young woman on one&#39;s own will entail. Abandoned by their feckless father, Rose and her family must move beyond their comfortable drawing room to discover a world of kind patrons, music teachers, and concert hall acclaim, but also domestic strife, anti-Semitism, and social pressure to marry. Set before World War I, Rebecca West&#39;s intimate, eloquent family portrait brings to life a time when women recognized their own voices and the joys of living off one&#39;s own talents. Dame Rebecca West (1892-1983) is one of the most critically acclaimed English novelists, journalists, and literary critics of the twentieth century. Uniquely wide-ranging in subject matter and breathtakingly intelligent in her ability to take on the oldest and knottiest problems of human relations, West was a thoroughly entertaining public intellectual. In her eleven novels, beginning with The Return of the Soldier, she explored topics including feminism, socialism, love, betrayal, and identity. West&#39;s prolific journalistic works include her coverage of the Nuremberg trials for the New Yorker, published as A Train of Powder, and Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, her epic study of Yugoslavia. She had a son with H.G. Wells, and later married banker Henry Maxwell Andrews, continuing to write, and publish, until she died in London at age ninety.</p><p></p><h2>Pride and Prejudice (Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p>&#34;It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&#34; Few novels have as passionate a following as Jane Austen&#39;s witty, perceptive tale of five sisters and their quest for marriage. When Elizabeth Bennett overhears the proud and arrogant Darcy insulting her, she develops a stubborn and blinding prejudice against him?a prejudice that may harm her family and her very chances for happiness.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

By integrating the histories of the Islamic and Byzantine worlds into the main narrative, author Clifford R. Backman offers an insightful, detailed, and often witty look at the continuum of interaction--social, cultural, intellectual, and commercial--that existed among all three societies. <br><br>Filled with relevant primary documents, this compelling volume surpasses traditional textbook representations of the Middle Ages by balancing the conventional focus on political affairs, especially those of northern Europe, with equally detailed attention to medieval society as it developed in the Mediterranean. In addition, Backman describes the ways in which the medieval Latin West attempted to understand the unified and rational structure of the human cosmos, which they believed existed beneath the observable diversity and disorder of the world. This effort to re-create a human ordering of "unity through diversity" provides an essential key to understanding medieval Europe and the ways in which it regarded and reacted to the worlds around it.<br><br>Thoroughly updated and redesigned, the second edition features an inviting and accessible layout and integrates captivating new illustrations--nearly twice as many as in the previous edition--to stimulate students' engagement with the material. Moreover, it offers a sophisticated analysis of gender, along with an intriguing examination of the tumultuous relationship between the Mediterranean and Islam.<br><br>An invaluable resource for both students and instructors, <em>The Worlds of Medieval Europe,</em> Second Edition, is ideal for undergraduate courses in medieval history, Western civilization, the history of Christianity, and Muslim-Christian relations. It also serves as an excellent supplement on the history of a specific country in the medieval period, the history of medieval art, or the history of the European economy.</p><p><br><strong>Clifford R. Backman</strong> is Professor of History at Boston University. He is author of <em>The Decline and Fall of Medieval Sicily: Politics, Economy, and Religion in the Reign of Frederick III, 1296-1327</em> (1995). He is currently writing a biography of James II of the Crown of Aragon.<br>"This fresh and often iconoclastic survey acknowledges the diversity of medieval experiences-from era to era, region to region, class to class. The solid and traditional political narrative is enriched with an energetic discussion of environmental and technological issues, while social<br>history, fascinating in itself, is successfully integrated into these contexts. Important intellectual themes of religion and philosophy are particularly accessible to students through a clear and focused examination of broader issues."--James W. Brodman, University of Central Arkansas<br><br>"This text is written in a lively, engaging, and sometimes deliberately provocative manner-a refreshing alternative to standard textbook style. I felt throughout that Backman was really considering his audience and having a conversation as much as writing a textbook."--Jennifer Kolpacoff<br>Deane, University of Minnesota, Morris</p><h2>Buddhist Ethics: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>The latter half of the twentieth century witnessed a growing interest in Buddhism, and it continues to capture the imagination of many in the West who see it as either an alternative or a supplement to their own religious beliefs. Numerous introductory books have appeared in recent years to cater to this growing interest, but almost none devotes attention to the specifically ethical dimensions of the tradition. For various complex cultural and historical reasons, ethics has not received as much attention in traditional Buddhist thought as it has in the West. Written by Damien Keown, one of the few experts worldwide who specializes in the area, <em>Buddhist Ethics</em> illustrates how Buddhism might approach a range of contemporary moral issues, ranging from abortion to euthanasia, sexuality to cloning, and even war and economics.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Raw, transparently honest, the Shrivers&#x2019; story alone is an inspiration, offering hope and practical strategies for healing. Now this updated and revised edition adds other real-life stories of betrayal and forgiveness, and new information defining adultery, including the destruction of emotional affairs. And since one in four marriages is touched by infidelity, the need for hope, and a biblical approach to saving a broken marriage, is greater than ever. The Shrivers have shared their story of redemption many times in such media as The 700 Club, Focus on the Family, and RBC&#x2019;s Words to Live By. Yet their most powerful testimony remains this book, a source of hope for wounded marriages everywhere.</p><p>Co-founders of Hope and Healing Ministries and a married couple, the authors offer what the subtitle affirms-hope and healing-in this revealing autobiography of their excruciating journey through infidelity. Each author takes a turn giving brutal expression to heartache endured in facing Gary's adultery and in subsequently working through adulterous betrayal. Movingly, each partner describes the process of looking at themselves, their marriage (before and after the infidelity), and the changes they wanted to make. Though the Shrivers present a strongly Christian perspective on dealing with adultery, their message is also pertinent to those outside the Christian faith community. Readers will appreciate their courage as well as the practical steps married couples can take to move through such a devastating experience and find forgiveness on the other side.

Yet he also harbors a hidden fear about how he may react when the horror and bloodshed of battle begin. Fighting the enemy without and the terror within, Fleming must prove himself and find his own meaning of valor.<p>Unbelievable as it may seem, <b>Stephen Crane</b> had never been a member of any army nor had taken part in any battle when he wrote <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. But upon its publication in 1895, when Crane was only twenty-four, Red Badge was heralded as a new kind of war novel, marked by astonishing insight into the true psychology of men under fire. Along with the seminal short stories included in this volume The Open Boat,&#x201d; The Veteran,&#x201d; and The Men in the Storm&#x201d; <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> unleashed Crane&#x2019;s deeply influential impressionistic style.</p><p><b>Richard Fusco</b> has been an Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph&#x2019;s University in Philadelphia since 1997.

A specialist in nineteenth-century American literature and in short-story narrative theory, he has published on a variety of American, British, and Continental literary figures.<br><br><b>From Richard Fusco's Introduction to <i>The Red Badge of Courage and Selected Short Fiction</i></b><p>What still fascinates is how, amid such conditions, Crane was able to informally pursue his aesthetic education and produce a novel that is one of the better summations of American sensibilities in the 1890s. His mind was, in effect, a sponge, capable of absorbing the principles of past and current literary traditions, the insights of the leading writers of the day, the beliefs held by competing philosophical schools, the dogmas held by diverse Christian sects, and the trends of political and economic thought. His artistic genius resided in his ability to knit many dissimilar and, at times, conflicting perspectives so thoroughly in a text that we pay more attention to their similarities than their differences. He paints a grim but objective portrait of war's horror in one passage in <i>Red Badge</i>, yet when we turn the page we find ourselves immersed in Fleming's subjective reflection about that event.</p><p>Many critics have debated over the years whether Crane was essentially a Realist, a Naturalist, or an Impressionist. I and many others contend that he was all those things and much more. For Crane, the scene or the moment dictates the artistic device the writer should employ. Novels such as <i>Red Badge</i>, then, become compendia of many aesthetic possibilities. In a Crane text, this oscillation among so many ways of looking at the world reflects what all humans must contend with in life. The religious, political, philosophical, or artistic belief that seems best to explain one moment may prove inadequate for the next. Crane's novel about the Civil War offers a chain of partially successful attempts by Henry Fleming to comprehend his environment and purpose. <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> thus not only chronicles Crane's own restless mind; it also embodies the multifaceted dilemmas with which all intellects curious about man's relationship with the universe must cope.</p><p>The dominant literary figures in the United States after the Civil War were the Realists. By the 1890s, Realism's most accomplished practitioners included Mark Twain and Henry James, but William Dean Howells had become the artistic director of the school. Through his magazine columns (the most prominent was "The Editor's Study" in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>), through the example he set in his novels and short stories, and through the new writers whose work he promoted, Howells established a good number of artistic principles for the postbellum generation of American fictionalists. Above all other considerations, he stressed that writers ought to write about subjects, people, and environments with which they were wholly familiar. Realists should not impose their personal biases or philosophical, political, and ethical predispositions on the voice of a text's third-person narrator. The world should be described as if one were looking through a camera lens. The Realist should avoid presenting portraits of people who reside at the extreme ends of the human condition; those who occupy the center of American society are fitter subjects for literary art. Thus, the goal of the writer is to capture with fidelity that which typifies a society.</p><p>These and other like precepts pervaded the literary scene that Crane encountered in New York during the early 1890s. They became salient and valuable for him after he heard Hamlin Garland lecture about Howells's work and influence in Avon, New Jersey, in 1891. Crane published a newspaper piece about the talk, which attracted Garland's notice. At that time, Garland, ten years Crane's senior, was himself an emerging Realist of the local-color school. Many American local colorists, who had their aesthetic origins in Ivan Turgenev's seminal short-story collection <i>Sportsman's Notebook</i>, published realistic fiction based upon their regional experiences, chronicling the lives and manners of the people they grew up with or lived among for a long time. Adherents to this approach included Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Rose Terry Cooke, Bret Harte, and George Washington Cable. During the summer of 1891, Garland himself contributed to this collective effort to portray America region by region through publishing <i>Main-Travelled Roads</i>, a story collection based on his family's farming experiences in the Midwest. (Donna Campbell provides an excellent discussion of Crane's tenuous relationship with the local-color movement in her <i>Resisting Regionalism: Gender and Naturalism in American Fiction</i>, 1885-1915; see "For Further Reading.")</p><p>When Crane began to gather materials for <i>Red Badge</i> in 1893, most of his immediate resources had realistic assumptions underlying their intentions. Matthew Brady's photographs of the Civil war had recorded with graphic accuracy the ghastliness of battle. Nonfictional reminiscences and novels such as Wilbur F. Hinman's <i>Corporal Si Klegg and His 'Pard'</i>, Joseph Kirkland's <i>The Captain of Company K</i>, and the novel that some critics believe marks the incipient moment of American Realism, John William De Forest's <i>Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Succession to Loyalty</i>, all share the desire to acquaint a civilian reader with the actualities of war and of military life.</p><p>Crane's most immediate source, however, owed its realistic intentions to another sort of discourse-history. In 1893 he borrowed from the mother of a former childhood playmate the multivolume work <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</i> (1887), a compilation of a mammoth series of articles that had first appeared in <i>The Century magazine</i> years earlier. Here Crane found a rich vein of primary material, including essays by participating Union and Confederate officers, such as Generals Darius N. Couch, Alfred Pleasonton, Oliver O. Howard, and R. E. Colston. With these accounts, Crane began to understand the facts, tactics, and strategies of the Battle of Chancellorsville that he would integrate into his story. Despite the occasional note of nostalgia or bravado, despite the defensive tone adopted by a general in explaining the misdeeds of his troops, these historical sources on the whole do comply with the empirical spirit pursued by a new generation of nineteenth-century historians. These writers presented firsthand testimony when available and assembled all known facts in their correct chronological sequence in order to illustrate an historical event as accurately as the evidence allows.</p><p>For all his research in these and other historical texts, however, Crane could not compensate for his one obvious deficiency, one that challenged any claim he might make to call himself a Realist. Realists were supposed to confine their efforts to subjects they knew well and had experienced intimately. Born six years after the Civil War ended, Crane had never even seen a battle before he finished the manuscript for <i>Red Badge</i>. His mentor Howells would later chide him about this predicament, telling him that Maggie was more artistically successful because he based it upon what he had lived and observed directly, unlike <i>Red Badge</i>, which was constructed from the observations of others and Crane's own guesses. How ironic it was, after the latter novel was published, that the reading public hailed Crane as the nascent star of American Realism.</p></p><h2>Real Property 2013 (Emanuel Law in a Flash)</h2><p>Study anytime, anywhere!

Tom, a more sensitive boy, admired these rough men and their distinctive clothing, designed for protection and utility.
